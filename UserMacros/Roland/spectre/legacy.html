<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Creating bookmarked PDFs for clinical study reporting has become a desirable
goal over the past few years. The scripts that come with Spectre <b><i>might
</i></b>be
able to create PDFs for some legacy systems. They might even be able to
create <b>bookmarked</b> PDFs if the "getitles" script is able to extract
the titles from the reports of the legacy system. Two different types of
legacy system will be described here where the scripts were successfully
used to create bookmarked PDFs. Whether this will work on your own legacy
systems is a matter of luck. For some it will work, for others not.
<h2>
Multi-output legacy systems</h2>
If your legacy system produces multiple outputs, rather than having the
output all in one file, then there is a chance the scripts can be used
for creating PDFs, if not bookmarked PDFs. Many of these systems either
create a list of output, all in the correct order, or a list is kept by
hand and the programmers edit in their output file names at the correct
point in the list to ensure the correct order. There is a good chance of
creating a PDF in this situation. It is important to know what paper type
the output was intended to be printed on (A4 or US Letter) and what the
intended margins are as this affects what script will be needed and how
the margins are specified to the script. There are two scripts named "a4ps"
and "usps" that you can use to create a PostScript file. Which one you
use depends on the intended paper size ("a4ps" for A4, "usps" for US Letter).
<p>Suppose a legacy system, such as the one described, used <b>US Letter</b>
paper with 1.0 inch margins all round and the list of output was in the
file "<b>outlis.txt</b>" then the following command might be able to build
the PostScript file. And if you have a good PostScript file, the rest is
easy.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>usps -r 1.0 $(cat outlis.txt) > myfile.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Both the "a4ps" and "usps" scripts, as supplied, default the margins
to 1.0 inch for all except the right margin which is 0.75 inches (looking
at the page in the "portrait" sense). So if any of the margins differ then
they must be specified.
<p>Once you have a PostScript file then you can turn it into a PDF using
either "a4ps2pdf" or "usps2pdf" depending on the paper size. The script
will create a file with the same name as the input file but with the extension
".pdf" like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>usps2pdf myfile.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Hopefully you will have a PDF and if you are lucky, it will be correctly
bookmarked as well. It is the script "getitles" that tries to identify
the titles in your output. Maybe it will need amending to do so correctly
or maybe a special version of it will be required. It is not an easy script
to maintain, though I have written it as best I can. You can link to it
below as well as a simple SAS&reg; software version of it.

<h2>
Single-output legacy systems</h2>
The simplest type of reporting system runs all the program code in sequence
in a single program that "includes" each code member in the correct order.
This single large listing will then be processed in some way to add "Page
X of Y" labels and the results written out to a new file. Scripts "a4ps"
and "usps" will require this file to be split into separate tables if they
are to work. It might be easy to do this. For example, if the first line
of the first page of a report contains the label "Page 1 of ", then it
is an easy matter to look for that label and to create a new output when
the label is encountered. And if the naming of the output files is alphabetical,
so that "a4ps" and "usps" will automatically pick then up in the correct
order, then it should be possible to create a PDF. There is a script named
"splitbiglst" that you might be able to use as-is or amended to do this.
This can be linked to below.
<br><a href="scripts/splitbiglst" target="_blank">splitbiglst</a>
<p>The above script will create files names file001.tmp, file002.tmp etc.
so they will be in the correct order for input to "a4ps" or "usps". Again,
you need to know what paper size the reports were intended for and what
margins to leave as both "a4ps" and "usps", as supplied, assume a one inch
margin all round except the right margin (in the "portrait" sense) which
is 0.75 inches. Assuming the reports were intended for A4 paper with a
one inch margin all round then once you had split the output using "splitbiglst"
you could create the PostScript file like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps -r 1.0 file*.tmp > myfile.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Once you have the postscript file, you can convert it to a PDF using
either "a4ps2pdf" (for A4 paper) or "usps2pdf" (for US Letter). In the
case of the above example you would use:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps2pdf myfile.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The output PDF will have the same name as the input file but with the
extension ".pdf".
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how you <b><i>might </i></b>be able to create a bookmarked
PDF for two types of legacy system. Whether it works or not is a matter
of luck.
