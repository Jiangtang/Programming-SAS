<h1>
SAS&reg; coding techniques used in Spectre (Clinical)</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This page will describe some sas techniques that not all programmers will
be familiar with. They might be of interest because these techniques I
will describe here have helped me, in part, to write Spectre. Most sas
programmers are at the level where they can write a single sas program
well. They know sas syntax well enough, the many functions they can use
and some programmers are fairly competent with sas macro language. However,
very few sas programmers can even attempt to write a "reporting system"
such as Spectre. To write a "reporting system" needs a good working knowledge
of the platform, such as Windows or Unix, because a reporting system will
surely need scripts or batch (.bat) files written to link components of
the reporting system together, but there is more to be learned on the sas
side to make a success of writing a reporting system.
<h2>
A "sasautos" library</h2>
The SAS Institute supply what is known as a "sasautos" library. It has
more than one hundred macros in it. Most sas programmers accept this as
"a given" in the sense that they know that that is the sasautos library
and "that is that!". The know they can add their own macro libraries to
the sasautos path but they accept that the only source of sasautos-type
macros is the one supplied by the SAS Institute. Actually, that need not
be the case. For clinical reporting purposes, the supplied sasautos library
is not very good, though it has some very useful macros in it. You would
be better off creating your own collection of macros and regarding that
as your working base. You would still want to have the SI supplied sasautos
library there as the last library declared to the sasautos path, otherwise
you would find that what you regarded as the sas macro functions %lowcase(),
%trim() and %left() no longer worked because these are actually macros
in the sasautos library and not sas macro inbuilt functions.
<p>Over twenty years I have built up a huge collection of sas utility macros.
Every time I think of a useful function or procedure to have in a macro
or have come across such macros at my place of work, I remember what this
macro does and I rewrite it at a later date in a way that fits in with
all the other macros I have got. It has got to the stage where I rarely
think of any more utility macros that I can usefully add. I say "usefully",
as I could think of some more utility macro to write but for all these
cases, %sysfunc() calls would get me close enough to what I am trying to
do. In 2007 I only added one new macro to my collection. "But what has
this got to do with Spectre?", you might be wondering. "How did it help
me write Spectre?" I'll tell you. <b>The sas macros in Spectre nearly all
came out of this collection of macros</b> and those that didn't were rewritten
or amended based on macros in that collection. There was very little new
in the Spectre macros. In most cases, as I realized I needed some of these
macros, I just copied them across from my old web site. <b>That is how
I developed Spectre so quickly</b>. The macros were already there! Many
of those macros call other macros in that same collection so it is not
a collection of unrelated macros. The other macro calls are listed in the
headers. They are meant to be a sasautos library. Developing Spectre would
have been impossible to do in the timescales without those macros being
there.
<p>You could build up your own collection of macros but my advice is not
to bother because I have already done this for you. You can use my macros!
I have put these in the public domain so that you can use them too. My
big collection of macros can be found <a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/maclist2.html" target="_blank">here</a>
and the subset of these macros I used for Spectre plus some Spectre-specific
macros are webbed <a href="macros/maclist2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
You are free to download them and use them if you want to. You don't need
to pay me a penny for their use and you don't need my permission either.
But should you distribute a commercial product that uses these macros then
you should make it clear to your customers which part of your product consists
of these macros. You can't expect the customer to pay for something that
you got for free!
<h2>
Function-style macros</h2>
A lot of the simpler macros in my collection are "function-style" macros.&nbsp;
In fact, I always try to write my macros as function-style macros where
I think it is appropriate. Function-style macros, if they worked as functions
in the strictest sense, would "return" a result. What function-style macros
do is nearly that. They sort of "boil down" or "resolve" into the result
so that the result is all that is left. In the macro code, this "result"
will be a statement that lacks an ending semicolon. If you think of the
SI supplied macro %lowcase() then you would use it like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let newword=%lowcase(OLDWORD);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What happens in this case is that %lowcase() acts on "OLDWORD" and changes
it to "oldword" in lower case, with no ending semicolon, so that "%lowcase(OLDWORD)"
<b>resolves</b>
to the string "oldword" leaving you with:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let newword=oldword;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>....so the value "oldword" gets assigned to the macro variable "newword".
<p>The reason I use function-style macros where I can is because they are
easier to call, they keep the code neater and effectively extend the power
of the sas macro language by adding extra functions. You can not use function-style
macros where your macro (or any submacro it calls either directly or indirectly)
contains procedures or data steps. As for data steps, you can sometimes
replace data steps with sas macro code that uses %sysfunc() calling SCL
for dataset handling and doing so avoids the data step boundary and allows
you to use it as a function-style macro. I have many macros of this type.
<p>To illustrate the difference between function-style macros and others,
consider the macro named %nobs(), that most sites possess, to give you
the number of observations in a dataset. I have one named the same. This
is the way most people implement it as an ordinary macro with a data step
inside:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let count=;</tt>
<br><tt>%nobs(dset,count);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>My %nobs() is a function-style macro and I call it like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let count=%nobs(dset);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above might not look like much of an advantage but then I can use
my macro in the convenient form:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%if %nobs(dset) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>..</tt>
<br><tt>..</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As I said, my %nobs() macro does not contain a data step (and nor does
its submacro) and this allows me to use it as a function-style macro. Take
a look at my %nobs() macro. It has a line in it with no semicolon at the
end. This is deliberate and is how it "returns" its value. You can can
link to it <a href="macros/nobs.sas" target="_blank">here</a> and you will
see it calls another macro named %attrn(), again a function-style macro,
which again has a line with no semicolon at the end, that uses %sysfunc()
calls to SCL statements for handling datasets that you can link to <a href="macros/attrn.sas" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>Having function-style macros allows you to use them in data steps, even
if they relate to other datasets and other dataset variables and their
properties, which gives you an advantage when writing complicated macros.
For an example of a complicated reporting macro where I have used a few
function-style macros to make coding it easier, look at %unistats() <a href="macros/unistats.sas" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
Macro version number messages</h2>
It is a very good idea to write to your sas log what macros you called
and what version numbers they are. Then if you have to recreate report
output at a much later date you can hopefully track down copies of the
macros of that same version number and then everything should work the
same and give the same result. Version numbers can stay the same with macros
until you get a non-backward compatible functional change or anything changes
that opens up the possibility of the macro giving a different result. But
<b>how
you write the message to the log</b> is important. You only want to see
this message <b>once for each macro</b>. If a macro is called multiple
times then it might clog up you log if it wrote a message each time it
was called. It is important to keep your logs as clean as possible so some
clever trick is needed to only write the macro and its version number once
to the log. The way that is done is to write to the log <b>outside the
macro definition</b>. You write it as free macro code before you even declare
the macro like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%put MACRO CALLED: crtitlesds v1.1;</tt>
<p><tt>%macro crtitlesds(flatfile,dsout);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Then when your macros is first invoked this message gets written to
the log, your macro "compiled" and then when you call the macro again,
this message is not part of the macro and so does not get written to the
log. To see what I mean, take another look at the two macros you can link
to in the previous section and see that their message that puts out the
macro name and version is done <b>before</b> the macro is defined. Not
many sas programmers are aware of this unusual feature. Even more unusual
is that you can use the "%if" statement outside the macro definition in
this way if you want to, so long as your macro is a sasautos macro. This
is surprising as "%if" statements are not allowed in open code.
<h2>
"Communicating" with sas programs</h2>
I have seen cases where somebody has tried to write a reporting system
but because of their lack of knowledge in doing this, they usually opt
to run all the programs in one sas call. This is a bad idea as there is
the possibility that what is left over in one program can affect a following
program. When they realize this then you might see some code added at the
end of every program to clear out the work libraries and formats and reset
the options to an agreed standard. It starts getting messy. If each program
ran in a separate sas session then there would not be this problem <b>but</b>
what sas programmers often realize is that they need to communicate some
piece of information to all the sas programs and that this information
is different for a full run of all programs rather than runs of individual
programs as is typical during development. So they think that there is
no alternative but to run all the programs in one sas session and set up
these values at the start before the first program runs. There will be
a block of code at the top of each program that is active for individual
runs when the program is being developed but must be commented out for
the collective run. Again, this is a bad idea, as there is no guarantee
that the programmer will remember to do this. It is also very messy and
to make it worse, after a program has been "validated", then the code must
be changed slightly by commenting out this block before it can be run in
"production". This introduces the chance of an error so by making this
sort of edit you might have "invalidated" a "validated" program. This is
a bad situation. This mess all comes from the mistaken belief that you
can not "<b>communicate</b>" with sas programs independently of changing
sas code or setting parameters. <b>You can</b>. One way to do this is to
change sas code in the
<b>autoexec.sas</b> member so that each program
can pick it up and so each program can run independently in its own sas
session. Although this is a much better way and avoids sas programs all
running together, it is still changing sas code, if only in autoexec.sas.
Sometimes this would be inconvenient due to the system setup. Luckily there
is another and much better way to do this and this is by using "<b>system
environment variables</b>". Most sas programmers have never heard of "system
environment variables" because they have little knowledge of the platform
they are working on, such as Windows and Unix, and what it can do. It is
not the programmer's fault as SAS software claims to be platform independent
and so programmers never bother to learn much about the platform it runs
on. If you have a script or a batch (.bat) file to run your sas programs
then you can set up an environment variable, give it a value and "<b>export</b>"
it. This makes it available to all the sas programs run by the script if
they know to look for it. In your sas code you can check to see what this
environment variable is set to using <b>sysget()</b> in a data step or
<b>%sysget()</b>
as a sas macro function. You might want to look at the SAS documentation
for these. <b>But there is a small problem</b>. Using %sysget() will cause
a warning message to be written to your log if the environment variable
does not exist, which will most likely be the case when you are developing
your program and trying to read a system environment variable that will
only be there for the final production run. It is best to avoid this warning
message. To get round this I use a macro I wrote called %readpipe(), which
reads the results of system commands, so that you can issue an "echo" command
for the system environment variable. Doing it this way avoids the warning
message. You can link to the %readpipe() macro
<a href="macros/readpipe.sas" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>Spectre has a macro named <b>%closerep()</b> that closes a report. It
looks at the system environment variable <b>OUTDIR</b> to determine which
directory it should put the final output files in and one called <b>DONELIST</b>
so it knows which "donelist" file to write an entry to (if OUTDIR is set)
to say what output has been created. Take a look at the code and see how
it is done. Note that for Windows (<b>&amp;sysscp EQ WIN</b>) it is done
differently than for Unix. Note the <b>%readpipe()</b> call. You can link
to the %closerep macro
<a href="macros/closerep.sas" target="_blank">here</a>.
