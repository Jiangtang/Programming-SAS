(THE WINDOWS RELEASE)</b>

not functional for Windows.
<p>Made easier to install by minimizing macro and script edits.
<p>Instructions for the Windows version installation added.
<p>All macros put out their version number on first invocation so reruns
done at a later date can be done using functionally identical macros.
<p>The "protocol" and "titles" dataset libref location is now indicated
by the global macro variable <b>_ptlibref_</b> set up in the allocation
macros and all scripts and macros now refer to this variable to locate
these datasets.
<p>Document added to show Spectre reporting from empty directories all
the way through to final report run plus show how Spectre can be a "push-button"
reporting system.
<p>New global macro variable <b>_popdone_</b> added to indicate to reporting
macros whether or not the population label has already been included in
the titles by the client titles macro.
<p>%pagexofy macro written to replace the "pagexofy" script and allow more
flexibility for the page label style.
<p>%npcttab v5.0 allows user-formatted level variables.
<p>%npcttab v6.0 adds the dsall= parameter so that it shows all categories
in the dataset optionally assigned to it with zero counts or blanks if
not in the input data.
