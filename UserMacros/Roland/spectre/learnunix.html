Learning Unix</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
It is a common conception among programmers working on Unix platforms that
so long as they have a working knowledge of the common Unix commands then
they know enough about Unix. This is true in most cases. But if you are
using Spectre, then as you get more proficient with it, your speed and
therefore your workload will increase to the point where you are responsible
for perhaps hundreds of programs at a time. To help you cope with this,
Spectre has many utilities to help you organise your work and you need
to have an awareness of them. But you will still find that you need to
know more about Unix beyond what is usual and understand "<b>redirection</b>",
"<b>piping</b>" and "<b>substitution</b>" and use these where appropriate.
You have maybe never heard of these terms. Programmers who move into Spectre
Administration or a Spectre technical support role will need to know how
to maintain or write simple <b>shell scripts</b>, which is at a higher
level of knowledge. For more complex shell scripts, you will need to know
some of the more powerful tools for this, such as <b>gawk</b>, which is
more complicated still.
<h2>
Common Unix Commands</h2>
The document you can link to below is aimed at programmers using Spectre.
After you have worked through it and tried out the examples then you should
know enough about Unix to be able to cope with the increased workload that
might be the result of using Spectre. In addition to what is contained
in the document, you should be thoroughly familiar with the utility scripts
that come with Spectre which are described on another page of this web
site that you can link to <a href="scripts/util.html">here</a>.
<p><a href="unixcom.html">Common Unix Commands</a>
<h2>
Writing bash shell scripts</h2>
I taught myself to write shell scripts. I have to admit that I found it
difficult but maybe it would have been easier if I had sent myself on some
courses. If you are a programmer who wants to learn to write shell scripts
then it is unlikely you will be sent on courses for this so you will have
to be self taught as well. At least you can benefit from my experience
using the following document. It should be enough to get you started, at
least.
<p><a href="bashscr.html">Writing bash shell scripts</a>
<h2>
Writing shell scripts that call SAS&reg; software</h2>
If you are a programmer using Spectre then you might end up choosing to
do all your development work in batch. Spectre favours the raw Unix environment
and working on programs in batch mode because great speed can be achieved
once you know the Unix environment well. But working in batch, you will
still need to know things like the contents of datasets, formats etc. that
you would normally get from an interactive session. But it is an easy matter
to have shell scripts that call SAS software to give you this information.
Spectre has many scripts that call SAS software, such as <a href="scripts/contentsl">contentsl</a>that
gives you details about a SAS software dataset. These scripts that call
SAS software are very easy to write. The only hard part of it is the SAS
software code itself but if you are a programmer who uses SAS software
then that shouldn't be a problem. Find out more about it in the link below.
<p><a href="sasscr.html">Writing shell scripts that call SAS&reg; software</a>
<h2>
Writing gawk programs</h2>
Sometimes you will need a script that has to do a lot of text manipulation
like you may have to do with SAS software from time to time. You can use
SAS software in a shell script, and many of the utility scripts that come
with Spectre do this, but SAS software is slow to invoke and for cases
where SAS software datasets are not being read or written it is better
to use the language <b>gawk</b> for this. If you have written code for
SAS/AF&reg; applications then you will notice that gawk is similar as you
can have a block of code that is run at the start, a main block of code
and a block of code that can be run at the end. You will see familiar functions
in gawk such as substr() that work in an identical way to SAS software
code. A superior language to gawk is Perl and if you had to make a choice
between learning either of those two languages then you should learn Perl,
but I learned gawk because it was more familiar to me due to all the SAS/AF
applications I had written in the past. The script "<b>getitles</b>" will
likely need to be tailored for your site. This is the script that extracts
the titles from the first ten lines of your output reports so that it can
be used in a PDF bookmark. This is mainly a gawk program. You can link
to getitles below to see what it looks like or learn more about gawk by
linking to "Writing gawk programs" below.

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
If you are a programmer working with Spectre then at some stage you will
need to increase your level of skill with Unix to match what is found in
the "Common Unix Commands" document above. Spectre is aimed at making programmers
who use it highly productive so this skill will help you manage hundreds
of programs at a time. If you are the Spectre Administrator or Spectre
technical support then it would be useful if you could maintain and write
simple shell scripts in addition, so knowing what is in "Writing bash shell
scripts" and "Writing shell scripts that call SAS software" should help.
Being able to write gawk programs would be of extra benefit as someone
will have to maintain the script "<b>getitles</b>", which uses gawk, that
is an essential script used by Spectre to extract titles from output reports.
