%xytitles - an example client titles macro</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Client titles macros are what the <b>%titles</b> macro calls to complete
the work of creating title lines and perhaps some footnote lines in the
client's style. How this should be done will vary from client to client
and will be an established layout that the client uses that is not open
to negotiation. Spectre imposes no layouts but instead relies on your having
written a client titles macro to do the work. The style is specified in
the <b>protocol.txt</b> file so if you set "<b>titlestyle: xy</b>" then
the <b>%titles</b> macro will make a call to the macro <b>%xytitles</b>
and it expects it to be there.
<p>The <b>%xytitles</b> macro explained here is <b>not a recommendation</b>
for setting out titles. It is an example client macro, and a fairly complex
one at that, which is useful in showing you how to approach the task of
writing such a macro. If you can understand how this macro works then you
should be well prepared to cope with writing any client titles macro. The
person whose job it is to write it may be the Spectre Administrator or
it may be given to a programmer or it may be me. As for getting advice
on writing this macro as part of the Spectre support contract then <b>this
is the advice!!</b> By talking you through this macro, this is all the
advice I can give you. However, if I do write a client style macro as part
of the support contract, then it will be on the condition that I can web
it here. Preference will be given to the client style macros of the major
pharmaceutical companies. Your own donations in this regard would be welcome
but I might rewrite it. I will build up a collection and web it.
<h2>
A word of caution</h2>
I have come across a case where a client's in-house system adds header
titles and a standard footnote to the final text report at the same time
as adding "Page x of Y" labels. This allows programmers to use all 10 titles
and footnotes as user-defined text -- the limit in SAS -- plus to add extra
standard header lines and footnote lines done automatically by the reporting
system. It is important that you establish with the client whether they
expect to be able to use all 10 title and footnote lines as user-defined
text and have the extra standard header lines and perhaps footnote lines
added by the system. A big clue as to their using all 10 lines as user-defined
text is the page number labels appearing on the same line as the first
logical "user" title such as "<b>Table 12.1.3&nbsp; (Page 1 of 2)</b>"
but you should not rely on clues alone.
<p>Spectre will allow you to break the 10 titles 10 footnotes limit by
calling an alternative to the %pagexofy macro, which you declare in the
<b>protocol.txt</b>
member, that could be called a "client pagexofy macro" and you can do this
unusual adding of extra titles and footnotes in that macro plus anything
else you need to do.
<h2>
%xytitles</h2>
This is an example of a complex client titles macro. It is complex in that
"<b>tables</b>" have one layout and "<b>appendices</b>" have a different
layout. Whether it is a table or appendix is defined in the ".titles" member
in the first title line such as "Table 1.2.1.1" or "Appendix 15.6.1.5"
(there must always be this first title in the ".titles" member). This gets
incorporated into the "titles" dataset and when these titles are read in
by the %titles macro, the global macro variable <b>_reptype_</b> gets set
to either "TABLE" or "APPENDIX" (without quotes) depending on the report
type defined. Since appendices are expected to run to many pages, a layout
is chosen to make use of every possible line on a page so the main title
(e.g. "Appendix 15.6.1.5") will be shown at the extreme right in the second
header line and the population (if selected on a population) will be shown
underneath it on the third header line at the extreme right. Both will
be shown in mixed case and no matter in what case the word "appendix" was
entered in a titles member, it will be shown with the first letter capitalized
and the rest in lower case to make sure it is consistent across the study.
For "tables", on the other hand, the main title (e.g. "TABLE 1.2.1.1")
will be shown in the centre of the report in capitals, will have a blank
line underneath it, then follows the rest of the titles and the last title
will be the population (again, capitalized). This is probably about as
complicated as they come but if it isn't, it probably won't get much worse.
You can open this macro in a new page by clicking on the link below.
<br><a href="sysmacros/xytitles.sas" target="_blank">%xytitles</a>
<p>Here is the start of the macro and an explanation:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%macro xytitles(program=,label=);</tt>
<p><tt>%*- set up global macro variables -;</tt>
<br><tt>%global _pagescript_ _tline2_ _tline3_ _tline4_ _figbkmark_;</tt>
<br><tt>%let _pagescript_=pagexofy;</tt>
<br><tt>%let _tline2_=;</tt>
<br><tt>%let _tline3_=;</tt>
<br><tt>%let _tline4_=;</tt>
<br><tt>%let _figbkmark_=;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>%*- set up needed local variables -;</tt>
<br><tt>%local popalert tcount;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>%*- Alert flag for when the population in the form &amp;_poplabel_
has -;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- been detected in one of the titles. If that is the case then
for -;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- a table, do not put out a following population title. -;</tt>
<br><tt>%let popalert=0;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the code above, first some global macro variables are set up. _pagescript_
is set to the name of the shell script, <a href="scripts/pagexofy" target="_blank">pagexofy</a>,
that <a href="sysmacros/closerep.sas" target="_blank">%closerep</a> will
call to add the "Page X of Y" titles as this might vary from client to
client. Unix is case sensitive so you might have a capitalized version
of pagexofy named PAGEXOFY that creates capitalized page labels like "PAGE
X OF Y". _figbkmark_ will be set to a bookmark that might be used for figures
and it will be made up of titles that will also be written to the global
macro variable _tline1_ _tline2_ etc. The value of _figbkmark_ will be
displayed in the log as well as all the other. <b>If you set up or possibly
change a global macro variable then you must display these in the log </b>so
that programmers know they have been set up and can use them if they wish.
This is done in all other Spectre macros and you should follow this convention
in the client titles macro.
<p>After the global macro variables have been declared, you can see that
two local ones have been declared. The "popalert" one is set to "0" and
explained.
<p>Now for the next chunk of code.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%*- For tables, make sure the word "TABLE" is in upper case in
first title -;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- and that the population label is also in upper case. -;</tt>
<br><tt>%if "&amp;_reptype_" EQ "TABLE" %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let _repid_=%casestrmac(&amp;_repid_,TABLE);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let _poplabel_=%upcase(&amp;_poplabel_);</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br><tt>%else %if "&amp;_reptype_" EQ "ATTACHMENT" %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let _repid_=%casestrmac(&amp;_repid_,ATTACHMENT);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let _poplabel_=%upcase(&amp;_poplabel_);</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- For non-tables, make sure the first letter is upper case and
the rest lower case -;</tt>
<br><tt>%else %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let _repid_=%casestrmac(&amp;_repid_,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %substr(&amp;_reptype_,1,1)%lowcase(%substr(&amp;_reptype_,2)));</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The three global macros variables <b>_reptype_</b> , <b>_repid_ </b>and
<b>_poplabel_</b>
are set in the <a href="sysmacros/proginfo.sas" target="_blank">%proginfo</a>
macro that is called by <a href="sysmacros/titles.sas" target="_blank">%titles</a>
before the client titles macro is called. Here, the type of report defined
to <b>_reptype_</b> will be used to drive this client titles macro. The
macro <a href="utilmacros/casestrmac.sas" target="_blank">%casestrmac</a>
is used to force any mixed case form of a string to the one specified and
you will see that for "TABLE" and "ATTACHMENT" (%proginfo sets _reptype_
values to upper case) the case for that string is set to upper case but
for others, the first character is capitalized and the rest set to lower
case. The value of <b>_poplabel_</b> is set to upper case for "TABLE" and
"ATTACHMENT" but is left as it is for other types of report. This value
of <b>_poplabel_</b> is set in <b>protocol.txt</b> and is not something
the user has supplied, so there will be no conflict of case for the population
label for other types of reports.
<p>Now for the next piece of code.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>*- set up and create the top three header lines of a standard report
-;</tt>
<br><tt>data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; length text $ &amp;_ls_ datestr $ 32;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- date string for draft report to add to the title -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; datestr=put(date(),weekdate32.);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; datestr=substr(datestr,index(datestr,",")+2);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; text="&amp;_drugname_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; substr(text,&amp;_ls_,1)='FF'x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; call execute("title1"||' "'||text||'";');</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; text="&amp;_protocol_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %if "&amp;_reptype_" NE "TABLE" and "&amp;_reptype_" NE
"ATTACHMENT" %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substr(text,%eval(&amp;_ls_-%length(&amp;_repid_)+1))="&amp;_repid_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; call execute("title2"||' "'||text||'";');</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; text="&amp;_report_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if index(upcase(text),'DRAFT') then text=trim(text)||" "||datestr;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %if %length(&amp;_poplabel_) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %if "&amp;_reptype_" NE "TABLE" and "&amp;_reptype_"
NE "ATTACHMENT" %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substr(text,%eval(&amp;_ls_-%length(&amp;_poplabel_)+1))="&amp;_poplabel_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; call execute("title3"||' "'||text||'";');</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The three "header" lines are set up and executed in this next piece
of code. These header lines will become title1, title2 and title3 as far
as sas knows them. The content of each title line is set up in turn the
variable "text".
<p>You will see that for the first header line it is set to the value of
<b>_drugname_</b>
and the page label character, which must be <b>"FF"x</b> and nothing else,
is put in the rightmost position that will fit on the page width by using
the value of <b>_ls_</b> that also gets set in the
<a href="sysmacros/proginfo.sas" target="_blank">%proginfo</a>
macro. A call execute follows which will be activated after the data step
ends.
<p>The second header line has the value of <b>_protocol_</b> on the left
and if <b>_reptype_</b> is not set to either "TABLE" or "ATTACHMENT" then
the right is set to the value of <b>_repid_</b> that had its case adjusted
in the previous code. Then follows the call execute to activate title2.
<p>The third header line is set to the value of <b>_report_</b> that is
set up in the <a href="sysmacros/protinfo.sas" target="_blank">%protinfo</a>
macro called earlier by <a href="sysmacros/titles.sas" target="_blank">%titles</a>.
If the word "draft" is detected in this string in any case then it will
put the current date at the end that was set up in the variable "datestr"
to tell you the date of the draft version of the output. If <b>_reptype_</b>
is neither "TABLE" or "ATTACHMENT" then the population label defined to
<b>_poplabel_</b>
is put on the far right. Then follows the call execute to activate title3.
<p>We have our three header lines now and they have been activated. They
are done. More follows.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%*- For tables, throw a blank title line, put table title on -;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- following line and then throw another blank title line. -;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- For others, just throw a blank title line to leave a gap. -;</tt>
<br><tt>%if "&amp;_reptype_" EQ "TABLE" or "&amp;_reptype_" EQ "ATTACHMENT"
%then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; title4 "&nbsp;&nbsp; ";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; title5 "&amp;_repid_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; title6 "&nbsp;&nbsp; ";</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br><tt>%else %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; title4 "&nbsp; ";</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>%*- do a quiet count of titles (i.e. do not display maximum values
yet) -;</tt>
<br><tt>%maxtitle(quiet)</tt>
<br><tt>%let tcount=&amp;_maxtitle_;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If <b>_reptype_</b> is "TABLE" or "ATTACHMENT" we have yet to put out
the report reference or main title. It has already been done on the far
right of the second header line for other types of report. This case of
this has already been adjusted so title4 is set to blank, title5 is set
to the main title and a blank title line put under it to conform with the
client style. For other types of reports, a blank title4 is created. The
number of title lines created is determined using the <a href="utilmacros/maxtitle.sas" target="_blank">%maxtitle(quiet)</a>
call and the value assigned to the local macro variable "<b>tcount</b>"
for use in further logic as follows.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >

<p><tt>&nbsp; *- generate the extra titles from the extracted titles -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %titlegen(_titles)</tt>
<p><tt>%end;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the first data step, all the titles (and footnotes) are extracted
for that program from the titles dataset. If we only find one observation
then this will be the table/appendix/whatever reference number and this
has already been put out in a header line or in a title so we have nothing
further to do. This is why the number of observations is checked using
<a href="utilmacros/attrn.sas" target="_blank">%attrn(_titles,nobs)</a>
and the following data step is executed only if the number of observations
is greater than one.
<p>Assuming more than one observation was found then the processing continues
as follows. In the titles dataset, the title numbers start at 1 and are
numbered sequentially. It knows nothing about what titles line you are
<b><i>really
</i></b>going
to use. We have already handled the title numbered 1 and so this is dropped.
The second, third and fourth title lines are written to global macro variables
for information purposes only, in case the programmer needs to use this.
Next the real number of the title line must be adjusted by the number of
titles put out already that is in the global macro variable
<b>_maxtitle_</b>.
This is only done for titles and not for footnotes.
<p>Next in the data step comes the translation of special characters. <b>You
must use this same code in whatever client titles macro you write</b>.
The lines of code you <b><i>must </i></b>use are shown in bold. Note the
substitution for the ampersand "&amp;". It <b>will not substitute</b> if
the ampersand is followed by an underscore. It allows for macro variables
<b>starting
with an underscore</b> to be substituted in titles and footnotes. If the
underscore is not the first character in the macro variable name then it
will show the ampersand as it is in the title or footnote. These characters
will get substituted back to what they were originally in the script that
adds the page labels which in this case is <a href="scripts/pagexofy" target="_blank">pagexofy</a>.
<p>Note that the local macro variable "<b>popalert</b>" gets set if it
sees "<b>&amp;_poplabel_</b>" in any of the titles in any case. This is
to tell it not to add the population label later, if this has already been
done.
<p>Next comes the activation of these new titles and possibly footnotes.
This is done using the <a href="sysmacros/titlegen.sas" target="_blank">%titlegen</a>
macro.
<p>Now we move on. For tables, the XY client wants the population label
as the last title line so long as it has not been put out already, as detected
by the "popalert" setting, so this code follows.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%*- For a table, put the population title as last title unless
it is -;</tt>
<br><tt>%*- blank or it has been detected in the title lines (i.e. &amp;popalert=1)
-;</tt>
<br><tt>%if "&amp;_reptype_" EQ "TABLE" and %length(&amp;_poplabel_) and
(&amp;popalert EQ 0) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %maxtitle(quiet)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %*- Only add this population title if some extra -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %*- titles were generated in the previous step. -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %if &amp;_maxtitle_ GT &amp;tcount %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title%eval(&amp;_maxtitle_+1) "&amp;_poplabel_";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Next comes the bookmark that <b><i>might </i></b>be used for figures.
I stress "might" because this bookmark will be set up in the global macro
variable <b>_figbkmark_</b> and will be used by default for figures but
if the programmer doesn't like what is in it then they are free to change
the value of <b>_figbkmark_</b> to whatever they want. t is calculated
for all types of report but will only be used for figures. There is no
particular reason why it is done for types of report other than figures
but it just seems logical to do it anyway.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let _figbkmark_=&amp;_repid_;</tt>
<br><tt>%if %length(&amp;_tline2_) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let _figbkmark_=%superq(_figbkmark_) %superq(_tline2_);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %if %length(&amp;_tline3_) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let _figbkmark_=%superq(_figbkmark_) %superq(_tline3_);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %if %length(&amp;_tline4_) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let _figbkmark_=%superq(_figbkmark_)
%superq(_tline4_);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br><tt>%let _figbkmark_=%superq(_figbkmark_) &amp;_poplabel_;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that %superq is used above because there is no telling what is
in _tline1_, _tline2_ etc. that might mess up the macro parser. With %superq
you are always safe.
<p>And now the last part. We display all the global macro variables we
have set up and might have changed (you <b><i>must </i></b>do this) and
after that we exit.
<br>&nbsp;
