<h1>
Installing Spectre (Clinical) on Windows</h1></center>

<p><br><b><font color="#3333FF">Note: If you arrived at this page directly
using a search engine such as Google then this may not be the "Spectre"
you are looking for. There are a few software packages of this name. This
"Spectre" is to do with clinical trials reporting.</font></b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b>If you just want to use the %npcttab and %unistats macros but do not
want to set up the whole of Spectre (Clinical) then installing it is easy.</b>
All you need to do is download the macros and copy them to a directory
that you then define to sasautos and then everything should work fine.
The rest of the information you can read here is to do with a full Spectre
(Clinical) install for those users planning to set up a full clinical reporting
system. If this does not apply to you then skip the rest of this page.
<p>There are a number of steps to installing Spectre. Some changes to a
shell script are needed. Other changes require a lot of thought, such as
how to allocate libraries for your sas programs as Spectre might need this
to be done differently to your established method. I will be updating this
page as I get feedback from users who have attempted to do this installation.
There will be things I have missed out and places where I have given unclear
instructions so please send me feedback by email on what is missing or
what is wrong so that I can improve this page. There is a contact link
for me at the bottom of this page.
<p><b>If you are doing this installation yourself</b> and you have never
done an installation like this before then use the following guidelines:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Do not start the installation process until you have all the components
available</b></li>

<li>
Read the installation instructions from beginning to end <b>before</b>
you start the installation process to make sure you can do it <b>all</b>.
You may have to arrange for people to help you. <b>Do not start it if you
know you can not finish it the same day</b>.</li>

<li>
Print off this page and work from the hard copy.</li>

<li>
Work through the installation process in the order listed. <b>Do not skip
anything or change the order</b>. Tick off processes when complete and
make notes on your hard copy of any difficulties encountered.</li>

<li>
<b>Never amend anything</b> in Spectre to "get the installation to work"
<b>unless</b>
the installation instructions tell you to do so. <b>Do not use workarounds
in any circumstances.</b></li>

<li>
Communicate unclear or missing installation instructions to the author
after you have attempted the installation <b>assuming you carefully followed
the guidelines given above</b> and yet still encountered problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
What you do not get with the Windows version</h2>
The Windows version of Spectre lacks the support for conversion to PostScript
and thence to bookmarked PDFs. Since Spectre uses PostScript for printing,
the printing scripts in Spectre will not work in this case. If you want
to print Spectre output on Windows then you should use your existing methods
for this.
<h2>
Cygwin</h2>
In order for Spectre to work on Windows, you need to install the Cygwin
Linux emulator. This is so that the Spectre scripts can run. To find out
how to install Cygwin on your PC, consult the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>
web site. Do a typical installation and add the extra things you need later.
At the start of installing Cygwin you will be shown a screen that shows
the directory it will download to and below it on the left will be "Install
For" for which you should choose the recommended "All Users" (unless you
really don't want other people to have access to it) and on the right "<b>Default
Text File Type</b>" for which you should change the default so that it
becomes the non-recommended "<b>DOS /text</b>".
<h2>
gawk and ssmtp</h2>
Some of the scripts require <b>ssmtp</b> (an email package) and <b>gawk</b>
so you need to make sure you have installed them from Cygwin. You can do
this as a later install. The <b>gawk</b> version installed should be 3.1.4
or higher.
<h2>
Make sure your .bashrc is working</h2>
A number of edits has to be made to your <b>.bashrc</b> file in your home
directory but you have got to be sure this <b>.bashrc</b> member is being
called and run (sourced). If you have just completed a Cygwin installtion
then check that this file is in your home directory. You can either use
the Windows Explorer or list the files that start with a period in your
Cygwin home directory using the command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>echo .*</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When I installed Cygwin on my PC it automatically put my <b>.bashrc</b>
member in my home directory. This is the correct situation. However, I
am hearing of plenty of cases where a Cygwin installation was done but
this <b>.bashrc</b> member <b>was found to be missing</b>. This is an error
and how to correct this will be explained here.
<p>If your <b>.bashrc</b> member is missing or empty then you should copy
it from <b>/etc/defaults/etc/skel/.bashrc</b>
<p>To test that your <b>.bashrc</b> in your home directory is being called
then add the following command near the top of the file:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>echo Hello from my .bashrc</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>....then when you start up your Cygwin session next time this "<b>Hello
from my .bashrc</b>" message should be displayed. If it is, then that is
good. You can delete this test message from your <b>.bashrc</b> member
when you make the edits to it as detailed in the next section "Changes
to .bashrc".
<p><b>If you do not see this message</b> when you start Cygwin, even though
you put the above command in your <b>.bashrc</b> member, then something
is wrong. You will be given instructions here to resolve this situation
to make sure your <b>.bashrc</b> member in your home directory is actually
being run (sourced) when you start Cygwin.
<p>First check your home directory and what shell is defined to you in
the <b>/etc/passwd</b> file. Browse this file and take a look. I have an
"Roland" entry shown below. The last two field members (separated by colons)
are "/home/Roland" that says where my home directory is and "/bin/bash"
that says my start-up shell is "bash".
<b>If your home directory entry
is not in the form /home/something then edit this file to correct it</b>
(after making a backup). Also, your start-up shell must be "/bin/bash"
otherwise it will not call your <b>.bashrc</b> member so change it to this
if it is not.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt><font size=-1>Roland:unused_by_nt/2000/xp:1006:513:U-DELL1\Roland,S-1-5-21-2888820645-753754486-1581935503-1006:/home/Roland:/bin/bash</font></tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Your <b>.bashrc</b> member is "sourced" from your <b>.bash_profile</b>
member in your home directory. If your <b>.bash_profile</b> member is missing
or empty then you should copy it from <b>/etc/defaults/etc/skel/.bash_profile</b>
<p>It could be that the problem is in your <b>.bash_profile</b> member.
Near the top of that member you should see it "sourcing" the <b>.bashrc</b>
file as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt># source the users bashrc if it exists</tt>
<br><tt>if [ -e "${HOME}/.bashrc" ] ; then</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; source "${HOME}/.bashrc"</tt>
<br><tt>fi</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Maybe you see something like that in your <b>.bash_profile</b> member
but for some reason it is commented out. Try uncommenting it by removing
the leading "#" from the script code so it looks the same as above. Also,
make sure your system environment variable HOME is resolving OK by using
this command.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>$ echo $HOME</tt>
<br><tt>/home/Roland</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Do you get a "/home/something" result like I do? If you get nothing
then your HOME environment variable is not set and bash will look for the
.bashrc file in the top directory /.bashrc
<p><b>You must get your .bashrc member active and working</b> before you
can continue with the Spectre installation. I believe the actions above
will resolve all situations where your <b>.bashrc</b> is not being sourced.
I am no Cygwin expert, though, so if you have tried the above and you still
can not get out your "Hello from my .bashrc" test message from the command
you put in your <b>.bashrc</b> member then you will have to <b>ask for
help on the Cygwin mailing list</b> aimed at getting your <b>.bashrc</b>
member sourced, after you have tried searching through the archives at
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank">www.cygwin.com</a>
to try to resolve your problem. Nothing less than this will get your problem
resolved. Do not continue with the installation of Spectre until this has
been resolved. When you do resolve it fully, in the sense that you get
your <b>.bashrc</b> working, rather than using a workaround, then please
let me know by email what your problem was and how it was resolved so I
can expand this section to help other installers.
<h2>
Changes to .bashrc</h2>
Once you have installed Cygwin and you are sure your .bashrc member is
working then you need to make some edits to it. To call SAS from the Linux
emulator session you will have to add the directory that contains the sas
executable (sas.exe) to your
<b>PATH</b> declaration. If you don't know
where it is located then do a file search on Windows on the SAS directories
contained in the "Program Files" subfolder. You should also add the Spectre
scripts to the PATH statement. Also, because SAS on Windows will not recognise
Unix-style path names, you will have to declare your home directory in
a way that SAS will understand it. For the Spectre scripts that call SAS,
a variable
<b>HOMEW</b> is set up and exported for this. The relevant entries
in my .bashrc file are shown below.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt># Add Spectre scripts to the path as well as the sas executables&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt># For SAS Learning Edition 1.0 on Windows 98&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>#PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/spectre/scripts:/cygdrive/c/PROGRA~1/SASINS~1/SAS/v8&nbsp;</tt>
<p><tt># For SAS Learning Edition 4.1 on Windows XP - note that file names
containing spaces must be quoted&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/spectre/scripts:/cygdrive/c/"Program Files"/SAS/"SAS
Learning Edition 4.1"&nbsp;</tt>
<p><tt># Set up HOMEW as a Windows path so SAS on Windows knows where my
home directory is&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>HOMEW=C:\\cygwin\\home\\$USER&nbsp;</tt>
<p><tt>export HOMEW</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I do not like any of the editors that come with Cygwin so for editing
a file I use <b>Wordpad</b> and for browsing a file I use "less". I have
no problem accessing "less" but in order to be able to use Wordpad I have
to define its location to my PATH as shown below. You might choose to do
the same. Note that if you use Wordpad as an editor or browser then it
will not understand unix-style path names. It will only work properly for
files without a path that are in the current directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt># Make Wordpad available as an editor</tt>
<br><tt>PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/"Program Files"/"Windows NT"/Accessories</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Changes to cygwin.bat</h2>
In the top Cygwin directory you will find the DOS command file <b>cygwin.bat</b>
and I have edited this to add some things I need. I use "<b>rxvt</b>" as
a terminal window (this can be downloaded from the Cygwin site) and I have
set up two environment variables named <b>EDITOR</b> and <b>VISUAL</b>.
The Spectre scripts will check if these have been set and for editing tasks
called within a script it will use what is defined to EDITOR and for browsing
a file it will use what is defined to VISUAL if set, otherwise will default
to browsing using "less". Here is the change I made to my <b>cygwin.bat</b>
<p>Before any changes....
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>@echo off</tt>
<p><tt>C:</tt>
<br><tt>chdir C:\cygwin\bin</tt>
<p><tt>bash --login -i</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here is my edited version. Note that you <b>must have the CYGWIN variable
set up</b> for Spectre scripts to work correctly. This may be set even
though there is no entry in cygwin.bat. To find out, use the command "<b><tt>set
| grep CYGWIN</tt></b>" to see if you get a line that starts with "<b><tt>CYGWIN=</tt></b>".
Also, if you are going to use <b>Wordpad</b> as an editor, then you must
define its location to the <b>PATH</b> statement as I showed you above
in the changes to <b>.bashrc</b> . You can also assign Wordpad to VISUAL
but I do not like to this this as it allows the user to edit the file they
open which I do not want. There is no option you can use with Wordpad to
open it in read-only mode, which is a shame. Note that if you use Wordpad
as an editor or browser then it will not understand unix-style path names.
It will only work properly for files without a path that are in the current
directory.
<p>After the changes I made....
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>@echo off</tt>
<br><tt>C:</tt>
<br><tt>chdir C:\cygwin\bin</tt>
<br><tt>set EDITOR=wordpad</tt>
<br><tt>set VISUAL=less</tt>
<br><tt>set CYGWIN=codepage:oem tty binmode title</tt>
<br><tt>rxvt -e bash --login -i</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Allocating macros and libraries</h2>
If you are the installer and not a programmer then you should inform the
senior programmer of the existence of the following page and tell them
that they have to take action on it.
<p><a href="alloc.html">Allocation of Libraries for Spectre</a>
<h2>
Macros and scripts</h2>
Spectre consists of three components; html documentation, macros and shell
script. <b>Only the macros and shell scripts need to be downloaded and
installed.</b> The macros and shell scripts must each have their own library.
The shell script library will have to be added to the PATH system environment
variable for users of Spectre at a point that is fairly early on the path
so that Spectre shell scripts take precedence over possible duplicate shell
script names on the system. What you need are the names of these two directories.
<p>Once you know the names of the two libraries then you are ready to download.
Both the <a href="macros.zip">macros</a> and <a href="scripts.zip">scripts</a>
come as zip files and the links to download them are highlighted in this
sentence. Some of the files are not wanted and you will be told which ones
to delete after you have unzipped them into their folders.
<p>For the macros you should delete any html and text files so delete "<tt>*.<b>html</b></tt>"
and "<b><tt>*.txt</tt></b>".
<p>For the scripts you do not need any of the html or text files so delete
"<b><tt>*.html</tt></b>", "<b><tt>*.txt</tt></b>"..
<p>Note that the scripts have to be executable. The following command should
make them so if issued from the same directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>chmod +x *</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Editing the "getfields" script</h2>
I have a number of scripts that generate sas program headers. They pick
out the names of the client, office, drug, protocol and increment from
the path name -- but based on <b>my own directory structure</b>. Your directory
structure might be very different. In any case, you might not like my program
headers and so will handle this yourself. But whatever, you will need to
edit the script <a href="scripts/getfields" target="_blank">getfields</a>
to display the client, office, drug, protocol and increment. Anybody who
writes scripts will find this easy to amend. If you have a support contract
with me then I might do it for you.
<h2>
Creating @index.txt in the scripts and macros directory</h2>
When you installed the macros and scripts you were asked to delete files
named @index.txt and this was intentional. Now is the time to recreate
these files to test the installation so far. Assuming the script directory
is on your path and the scripts that call SAS software have been correctly
changed then it should be possible to run the script <b>newix</b> in each
of the scripts and macros directly and it should create the file @index.txt
. First "cat @index.txt". If the file is there then delete it. Next use
the command "newix" to recreate the "@index.txt" file.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>newix</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>What happened?</b> Is the "@index.txt" file correctly created when
you run the "newix" command? This is the first hurdle to overcome in the
installation process. The supplied @index.txt for macros looks like <a href="macros/@index.txt">this</a>
and for scripts it looks like <a href="scripts/@index.txt">this</a>. Is
that what you got? Did you get any file created? You might have got a script
error, in which case you can probably fix it. If you got an error within
the SAS software code that caused it to stop then there is no log file.
The reason there is no log file is because it gets deleted at the end of
the script. To stop it being deleted then put a "#" in front of the log
file name. That turns the rest of the line into a commant. Once it is working
then remove the "#" you added. When you have got over this hurdle then
relax. The first hurdle has been overcome.
<h2>
Getting "showfmts" and "showfmt" working</h2>
The next hurdle to jump is getting the scripts "<b>showfmts</b>" and "<b>showfmt</b>"
working. These are the scripts that display a list of all formats and details
of a specific format. Taking "showfmts" to start with, this will only work
if the allocation macro reference has been changed and the new allocation
macro is working (if any), that the Spectre macros are on the sasautos=
path and that the correct formats are assigned to the fmtsearch= path within
the new allocation macro (or correctly done in the autoexec member if an
allocation macro is no longer required). Assuming you are in a study data
directory then type in the command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>showfmts</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What happened? If you got nothing then keep the sas log by putting a
"#" in front of its name in the delete statement at the end of the script.
You may have to add the "mprint" option to the SAS software code in that
script to help work out what is wrong.
<p>When you get it working then try out the "showfmt" script as well on
one of the formats listed out by the "showfmts" script. Character formats
will need to have the dollar sign preceded by a "\" escape character to
stop Unix assuming it is a Unix variable. Try showfmt on a numeric variable
if need be. Does it work?
<p>This is the second hurdle. Once this has been overcome then the rest
should be easy.
<h2>
Make the two directories read only</h2>
Assuming everything is working so far then it is time to make the members
of the scripts directory and macros directory read only. The following
command should work:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>chmod g-w *</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It would be a good idea if the directory itself had no update access
for the users otherwise one of them might manage to delete one or two of
the members.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
If you have got this far then you should be ready to use Spectre. I am
sure I have forgotten something that should be on this page and I am sure
you will hit extra problems, though. You can always email me (contact link
below) and I will try to help, even if you do not have a support contract.
If the latter then I may not be able to give much of my time, it depends
on my priorities, but I will do what I can and am interested in having
feedback from people who have gone through this installation process.
