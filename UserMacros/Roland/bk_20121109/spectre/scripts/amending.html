Amending Spectre (Clinical)</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This document carries on from where the "Key Components of Spectre" document
left off. The "Key Components" document tells you which parts of Spectre
must not be changed and which parts can be changed. To recap that document,
you <b>must not change any of the macros</b> (apart from %unimap, as was
described) but you can change the scripts, replace the scripts or not use
them at all. If you are thinking of using Spectre then do not assume it
is imposing a structure and a set of program naming convention on you.
It is not. What you see on this web site is more like a full-blown example
of Spectre in use that is written in a way that illustrates its full capabilities.
You are free to make changes to it and how you would typically do this
to meet your site standards for naming programs and output will be described.
<h2>
Maintaining the scripts</h2>
There are more scripts in Spectre than there are macros. It is the scripts
that mostly need changing when tailoring Spectre and this can seem a fearful
task to a sas programmer who is used to sas but does not know the platform
well or how to write shell scripts. Scripts are something you can get used
to. There are a few complicated scripts webbed here to do with creating
PDFs, but as for most of them, you will learn in time that they are trivial
and easy to amend or rewrite. Whoever "looks after" Spectre at your place
of work must be prepared to maintain the scripts as the way you end up
using Spectre may not be what the supplied scripts are expecting. There
is a lot of documentation on this web site about learning Unix commands
and writing shell scripts to help you, but instead of learning this all
in one go, you might prefer to amend the scripts as you need to until you
reach the point where you feel confident about learning all this material.
What I will be assuming, during this document, is that you do not feel
confident with scripts yet and you need a lot of guidance in changing them.
<h2>
alltitles</h2>
You have to edit the <b>alltitles</b> script to make sure the file pattern
it is using matches the program names for which you want to store titles
in the titles dataset. The file pattern I am using in the script is:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>[xgtl]*.titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>....which matches any file that starts with "x", "g", "t" or "l" and
ends with ".titles". Your valid program names might start with other letters
and need other matching characters. Suppose your valid program names had
to start with "t_", "l_" or "f_" then your file pattern would be:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>[tlf]_*.titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that "pattern matching" is not the same thing as "regular expressions".
I explain this briefly in my "Common Unix Commands" document <a href="unixcom.html#patt" target="_blank">here</a>.
If you are not sure about your file pattern then go to the directory where
all your titles members are held and do an "echo" command on your file
pattern like this to see if it lists what it should do:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>echo &lt;filepattern>*.titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you look at the <b>alltitles</b> script it makes it very clear where
you can do the edit to match your program file pattern. You can look at
it (it will open in a new window) <a href="scripts/alltitles" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
makerun (for reports)</h2>
The script <b>makerun </b>generates the script <b>runreports</b> that runs
all the reporting members. It gets this list from the titles dataset using
the scripts <b>intitlesds</b> and <b>intitlis</b> to get a list of programs
and their output. In the code, if a program name starts with an "x" then
it is excluded from the generated <b>runreports</b> script. This is because
these "x" programs are "extra analysis" programs that run after the main
analysis has been done. These extra programs are handled in the <b>makexrun</b>
script instead which is expecially for a run of "extra analysis" programs.
If your "extra analysis" programs begin with a different letter then you
will have to edit the code where you see the following. Look for the "grep
-v ^x". "-v" as used in grep means "not" and the "^" means "begins with"
so it is selecting those programs that "do not begin with 'x' ". If you
do not have any "extra analysis" programs and your regular reporting programs
do not begin with "x" then it will do no harm to leave this code in.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt># get a list of reporting sas programs and their lisfile names</tt>
<br><tt># (excluding "extra" analysis programs)</tt>
<br><tt>intitlis | grep -v ^x | sed 's%\r$%%' > ~/rproglis_$$.tmp</tt>
<p><tt># get a list of reporting sas programs (excluding "extra" analysis)</tt>
<br><tt>intitlesds | grep -v ^x | sed 's%\r$%%' > ~/rprogs_$$.tmp</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This code is not marked in any clear way and is near the top of this
long script that you can link to <a href="scripts/makerun" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
makexrun</h2>
The script <b>makexrun</b> generates the script <b>runxreports</b> that
runs all the "extra analysis" programs. Maybe you don't have any of these.
These extra analysis programs start with an "x" in the way I have it set
up on this web site so I select on these programs that start with "x" in
the code like this. Look for "grep ^x":
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt># get a list of extra analysis reporting sas programs and their
lisfile names</tt>
<br><tt>intitlis | grep ^x | sed 's%\r$%%'&nbsp; > ~/rproglis_$$.tmp</tt>
<p><tt># get a list of extra analysis reporting programs</tt>
<br><tt>intitlesds | grep ^x | sed 's%\r$%%' > ~/rprogs_$$.tmp</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The "grep ^x" will select on members that start with an "x" (the "^"
means "begins with" in this case). If you have "extra analysis" programs
that start with a different letter then you will have to amend this. If
you don't have any "extra analysis" programs then you can leave it as it
is because you won't be using this script in any case. You can link to
the script <a href="scripts/makexrun" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
makerun (for derived datasets)</h2>
The script <b>makerun</b> generates a script named <b>runderived</b> to
run the programs that create the derived datasets. It could be that you
do not create derived datasets and instead get them created by an external
organisation, in which case you will never need to run <b>runderived</b>,
or your program naming conventions for the sas programs creating the derived
datasets could be very different from what the <b>makerun</b> script is
expecting. In this case you might want to amend the script extensively
or replace it with an in-house written script. Another alternative would
be to use the <b>runderived</b> script as generated as a template and edit
in the programs you want to run. If you do this you should rename <b>runderived</b>
as something else otherwise it will get overwritten next time <b>makerun</b>
is run.
<p>When creating the derived datasets then the order the programs run is
important. This is not the case for the reporting programs as there should
be no dependencies between any of the programs. Also, if a program ends
due to an error, it would be better to abort the rest of the derived dataset
build programs. This is not so important for the reporting programs where
there are no dependencies so it would be normal to carry on with the rest
of the reporting programs even if one or more of them failed.
<p>The way the <b>makerun</b> script generates <b>runderived</b> is by
using the script <a href="scripts/derorder" target="_blank">derorder</a>
("derived dataset program order") which looks for program names matching
the file pattern "<b><tt>ls -1 [sd]*[0-9]_*.sas</tt></b>". In other words
the program name must start with an "s" or a "d" (short for "stats" and
"derived"), be followed by one or more characters which are followed by
a numeric digit followed by an underscore, followed by other characters
and ending ".sas". This would match program names like d01_demog.sas and
s02_effic.sas and then it will sort by calling <a href="scripts/sortnpref" target="_blank">sortnpref</a>
("sort using the numeric prefix") with the start letter as a secondary
key to give the order in which the programs should be run. It is up to
the user to choose the numeric prefix so that the programs run in the correct
order. You may not want to use this system at all, in which case you could
write your own script for running these programs, or you may want to fit
your naming conventions to make use of this numeric prefix as it is quite
a useful method for ordering programs.
<h2>
To recap so far</h2>
If you have performed the needed amendments as described above then you
will be able to run all the programs that create the derived datasets,
you will have defined to alltitles all the programs you want to store titles
for and you will have defined to makerun and makexrun all the programs
that should be part of the normal run and all the programs that should
be part of the "extra analysis" run. Spectre should therefore be able to
run all the programs as fit in with your site standard. You can see that
Spectre is very flexible, although you have to do a bit of script editing
to get there.
<h2>
The titles and protocol datasets</h2>
The <b>question</b> with the titles and protocol datasets, that get created
from the ".titles" members and "protocol.txt", is <b>where to put them</b>.
Early versions of Spectre put them in with the other derived datasets,
however there was some confusion as to whether it mattered if these datasets
had timestamps on them that were later than the final full run of the derived
dataset build. Having later timestamps "looked bad" as it might indicate
that something had changed in the derived datasets. But the titles and
protocol dataset are nothing to do with the derived datasets -- they are
datasets only because it is convenient and more efficient to store them
as datasets. They would be better off kept away from the derived datasets
to avoid this confusion so I changed the scripts and macros to allow the
user to reroute these datasets to another library. Some sort of "utility"
library would be better. The libref you keep them in is then defined to
the global macro variable <b>_ptlibref_</b> and you have to edit the allocation
macros that Spectre uses, to assign this value of a libref to <b>_ptlibref_</b>
in the macros <a href="macros/allocr.sas" target="_blank">%allocr</a> and
<a href="macros/allocw.sas" target="_blank">%allocw</a>. You would typically
set these two macros up in the study and increment macro library. If you
have a "utility" directory as part of your study library structure then
I would recommend you route them to there. They should be held at the lowest
level so that they clearly go with your programs at the study and increment
you are working on and not with some previous increment or other study.
<h2>
autoexec.sas</h2>
<b>Spectre expects to be able to find all the macros that it needs without
you doing further allocations</b>. This means the allocation of macro libraries
should be done in the autoexec member. You may have a high-level version
or a low level version. A low-level version would reside in the current
directory but since your derived dataset programs and reporting programs
might be in different directories then it might be tidier to use a high
level autoexec.sas member that can detect which study library you are in
and assign the macro libraries to sasautos accordingly. It might not be
possible to do it this way, though. It depends on your site standards.
Another method could be to "link" to it from the derived dataset and reporting
programs folders so that you only referenced the one copy. You will have
to learn what your site standards are for this and follow it, but if you
are using Spectre, then you must comply with its need to <b>have all macros
libraries correctly assigned at sas invocation</b>. On my PC I keep this
at the highest level and assign macro libraries depending on which study
area I am in. You can view it (best viewed as "source") <a href="macros/autoexec.sas" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
the client titles macro</h2>
The <b>client titles macro</b> is where you will be doing some serious
sas work. This is the macro that displays selected information put in <b>protocol.txt</b>
in header lines and perhaps a footer line as well according to the client's
needs. You will need one of these macros for each client. Maybe multiple
macros for each client if their different regional offices you are doing
work for, require different layout styles. The %xytitles macro, which is
there for demonstration purposes only, is an example of a client titles
macro with a particularly demanding layout style in that "appendix" outputs
have their "populations" displayed in one of the header lines, instead
of one of the user-defined titles, in order to save a line of text so that
more data can be fitted on the report. Where the macro is simpler than
it could be is that it does not put out a standard "footnote line" that
would typically state what program was running along with the name of the
output file it created. Most clients will want this. This macro is already
adequately covered on its own page <a href="xytitles.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
How you would typically amend Spectre to fit in with your site standards
has been explained in this document.
