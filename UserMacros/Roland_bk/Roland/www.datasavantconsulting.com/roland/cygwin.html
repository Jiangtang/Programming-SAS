<h1>
Cygwin and SAS</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 17 November 2007]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
At long last I can run Unix (well, Linux) on my PC and for free. I can
develop shell scripts including scripts that call SAS/LE on my PC. It took
some setting up though and is not without its frustrations. I will go into
the details of how to set up Cygwin but first I wanted to blow my trumpet
over Unix. The essence of Unix is having <b>small utilities that "talk"
to one another</b>. Utilities that pass their output to another utility
using piping and other means. You can build very impressive applications
like this even though it is not easy to conceive how a collection of simple
things can be built up into complex applications. As SAS programmers we
are used to seeing monolithic code grow and grow to enable us to meet our
reporting needs. Most of us "think big" to achieve our aims and so we tend
to go down the path of ever-increasing complexity. Unix is a refreshing
change from that and also a challenge to our method of working. Unix achieves
more by "thinking small". Its utilities give information in a simple form,
writing it to "standard output" (by default, the terminal) and reading
its information, often, from "standard input". By reading from and writing
to understood locations and by having the output format simple, then it
allows utilities to work togther. And when they can work together you have
the chance to build complex applications that go beyond what you can imagine
with the "think big" approach. If you write Unix shell scripts then you
too should follow this ideal. Output should always go to "standard output"
(and not a file) and the format of the data should always be simple. The
"end user" you aim to keep happy is no longer a person. Instead it is other
script writers who may someday need to read in the information that your
shell script writes out. That is why you write to standard output and why
you keep the presentation of results crude and simple. If need be, a final
extra utility could be written to beautify the output, but it should not
be part of the utility that provides the information. Enter the world of
Unix and you enter a realm where <b>"think simple" works</b> and can pay
great dividends. You may not be able to see that far at this stage -- you
will just have to take it on trust for now. This "think small" approach
will ultimately manifest itself in the SAS code you write. You will think
of simple utility macros that you can write and call. Your code will turn
into calls to macros and passing on the output to other macros. Instead
of your code turning into complex macros itself, it will tend to take the
form of simple code calling utility macros. Macros can obscure or clarify.
It depends how they are written and how they are used. Calling utility
macros in open code tends to clarify, whereas turning all your code into
macros that call other macros tends to obscure. The Unix "think simple"
approach can reap rewards in your SAS code as well.
<h2>
Downloading Cygwin</h2>
Cygwin can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">www.cygwin.com</a>
for free. You will download a setup.exe file. When you run that file and
opt to install from the Internet then you will be offered a number of download
sites to choose from. Here it starts to get complicated. There are different
versions on these sites. If you are a non-US keyboard users then you will
require a utility named "rxvt" which is an enhanced terminal emulator.
This is because, due to a bug in the software, the default emulator will
not accept the "pipe" character that looks like | (note that is not the
same as another character with a break in the line that looks like &brvbar;
). You will get nowhere learning Unix unless you can type this character,
so all non-US users need "rxvt" instead which does accept this pipe character.
In any case, if you are a US user, the "rxvt" terminal emulator is much
better than the default terminal emulator-- you can highlight and paste,
for example, so you are recommended to use it. So what happens is that
you double click on setup.exe and then you select a site. It then reads
pakage information from that site and displays a window where yu can select
what packages you want. "Rxvt" is in the "shells" set of packages. Expand
that directory and make sure "rxvt" is listed. If it is not then quit,
start again by double clicking on setup.exe and choose another download
site. Keep doing this until you see "rxvt" listed in the shells. Tick the
box to say you want it installed. You should go for the default install
but with "rxvt" added. Once you have selected what you want then the install
will take its course. At the end you will be asked if you want the Cygwin
icon on your desktop and you should reply that you do.
<h2>
A Cygwin installation problem</h2>
When I installed Cygwin on my PC it automatically put my <b>.bashrc</b>
member in my home directory. This is the correct situation. However, I
am hearing of plenty of cases where a Cygwin installation was done but
this <b>.bashrc</b> member <b>was found to be missing</b>. This is an error
and how to correct this will be explained here.
<p>A number of edits has to be made to your <b>.bashrc</b> file in your
home directory but you have got to be sure this <b>.bashrc</b> member is
being called and run (sourced). If you have just completed a Cygwin installtion
then check that this file is in your home directory. You can either use
the Windows Explorer or list the files that start with a period in your
Cygwin home directory using the command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>echo .*</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If your <b>.bashrc</b> member is missing or empty then you should copy
it from <b>/etc/defaults/etc/skel/.bashrc</b>
<p>To test that your <b>.bashrc</b> in your home directory is being called
then add the following command near the top of the file:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>echo Hello from my .bashrc</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>....then when you start up your Cygwin session next time this "<b>Hello
from my .bashrc</b>" message should be displayed. If it is, then that is
good. You can delete this test message from your <b>.bashrc</b> member
when you make the edits to it as detailed in the next section "Changes
to .bashrc".
<p><b>If you do not see this message</b> when you start Cygwin, even though
you put the above command in your <b>.bashrc</b> member, then something
is wrong. You will be given instructions here to resolve this situation
to make sure your <b>.bashrc</b> member in your home directory is actually
being run (sourced) when you start Cygwin.
<p>First check your home directory and what shell is defined to you in
the <b>/etc/passwd</b> file. Browse this file and take a look. I have an
"Roland" entry shown below. The last two field members (separated by colons)
are "/home/Roland" that says where my home directory is and "/bin/bash"
that says my start-up shell is "bash".
<b>If your home directory entry
is not in the form /home/something then edit this file to correct it</b>
(after making a backup). Also, your start-up shell must be "/bin/bash"
otherwise it will not call your <b>.bashrc</b> member so change it to this
if it is not.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt><font size=-1>Roland:unused_by_nt/2000/xp:1006:513:U-DELL1\Roland,S-1-5-21-2888820645-753754486-1581935503-1006:/home/Roland:/bin/bash</font></tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Your <b>.bashrc</b> member is "sourced" from your <b>.bash_profile</b>
member in your home directory. If your <b>.bash_profile</b> member is missing
or empty then you should copy it from <b>/etc/defaults/etc/skel/.bash_profile</b>
<p>It could be that the problem is in your <b>.bash_profile</b> member.
Near the top of that member you should see it "sourcing" the <b>.bashrc</b>
file as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt># source the users bashrc if it exists</tt>
<br><tt>if [ -e "${HOME}/.bashrc" ] ; then</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; source "${HOME}/.bashrc"</tt>
<br><tt>fi</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Maybe you see something like that in your <b>.bash_profile</b> member
but for some reason it is commented out. Try uncommenting it by removing
the leading "#" from the script code so it looks the same as above. Also,
make sure your system environment variable HOME is resolving OK by using
this command.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>$ echo $HOME</tt>
<br><tt>/home/Roland</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Do you get a "/home/something" result like I do? If you get nothing
then your HOME environment variable is not set and bash will look for the
.bashrc file in the top directory /.bashrc
<p><b>You must get your .bashrc member active and working</b> before you
can continue. I believe the actions above will resolve all situations where
your <b>.bashrc</b> is not being sourced. I am no Cygwin expert, though,
so if you have tried the above and you still can not get out your "Hello
from my .bashrc" test message from the command you put in your <b>.bashrc</b>
member then you will have to <b>ask for help on the Cygwin mailing list</b>
aimed at getting your <b>.bashrc</b> member sourced, after you have tried
searching through the archives at
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">www.cygwin.com</a>
to try to resolve your problem. Nothing less than this will get your problem
resolved. When you do resolve it fully, in the sense that you get your
<b>.bashrc</b>
working, rather than using a workaround, then please let me know by email
what your problem was and how it was resolved so I can expand this section
to help other installers.
<h2>
Cygwin Installation Options</h2>
At the start of installing Cygwin you will be shown a screen that shows
the directory it will download to and below it on the left will be "Install
For" for which you should choose the recommended "All Users" (unless you
really don't want other people to have access to it) and on the right "Default
Text File Type" for which you should change the default so that it becomes
the non-recommended "DOS /text". You use this latter option where you are
freely mixing use of Windows and Cygwin such as editing scripts using a
Windows editor such as Wordpad. I assume you will be doing this.
<h2>
Wordpad</h2>
You are going to have to do some editing. Never use Notepad for this. Always
use Wordpad. This is going to be your sole editor for all your Unix work
and you should keep to plain text. You should make sure you have it on
your desktop so that you can drag and drop Unix files onto it. You can
create a shortcut to Wordpad using one of the options in the right mouse
button. Once you have created the shortcut you can drag it onto your desktop.
The idea is that you will have your Windows Explorer open and can drag
and drop files from there onto yur Wordpad icon on your desktop. But please
remember that you will be using Wordpad for all your Unix work and never
Notepad.
<h2>
cygwin.bat</h2>
If everthing is downloaded, then, by default, "rxvt" is not invoked when
you start up Cygwin by double-clicking on the icon but feel free to start
up Cygwin, anyhow, to make sure it has installed correctly and then exit
with the command "exit". In the cygwin directory is the DOS start-up file
named "cygwin.bat". This is a DOS file and so can be edited with Notepad,
if you like. Make a backup of this file and edit the original. Here you
will need to reference an Internet site where there is a copy of the cygwin.bat
file you will need. It is <a href="http://www.freemode.net/archives/000121.html">here</a>.
This will enable the rxvt terminal next time you start up. We are not done
with editing yet, though. If you are using Wordpad then copy the text on
the Internet page and when you paste it into Wordpad select "paste special"
from the Edit pull-down menu and select "Unformatted text". You will always
be using this option with Wordpad. Replace what is in your file with exactly
what is listed for the cygwin.bat file on the Internet page.
<h2>
.Xdefaults</h2>
You can customise the rxvt session for colors, font, size etc. and you
should do this to suit your needs. You will need to create a file in the
cygwin/home/Defaults directory (that will be your home directory) named
.Xdefaults (with a period in front of the name). Here is where you use
your first Unix command for real. Log onto Cygwin. You will be in your
home directory (you can check by entering the command "pwd"). List all
the files, including the "hidden" files by entering the command "ls -a".
You will see one named <b>.bashrc </b>. Make a copy of this file and call
it .Xdefaults using the command "<b>cp .bashrc .Xdefaults</b>" (period
in front of each name). Once you have done that you can drag it onto the
Wordpad icon and edit it. Delete everything that is there and replace using
the code on the Internet page for .Xdefaults. Again use "paste special"
from the Edit pull-down menu and "Unformatted text". There are a few changes
to what is on the Internate page that I would recommend. Change the "geometry"
value to 80x25 instead of 80x80. Change the Lucida font size to 14, instead
of 12 and change the background color to 000040 instead of 000020. Once
this is done then save the file and start up Cygwin again. Try out the
pipe character (remember it looks like | and not &brvbar;) using the command
"<b>ls -a | cat</b>".
<h2>
.bashrc</h2>
I have written a number of shell scripts which I keep in their own directory.
It hangs off the C: drive and is not part of the cygwin directory structure.
My directory is named "shellscripts". I want to invoke them by name so
in order for Unix to find these I have to add it to my PATH at startup.
To do this you have to edit your <b>.bashrc</b> file and I have added the
line:
<p><b>PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/shellscripts</b>
<p>Note that the C: drive is referred to as /cygdrive/c . This is cygwin's
way of mapping the drives so that Linux can understand it. Also note the
colon. You use colons to separate directories on the PATH. What this is
doing is setting PATH to be what it was before ($PATH) but with a new directory
added on the end.
<h2>
Linking to SAS</h2>
Unix has got to find SAS, somehow, if you have SAS on your PC. You can
add the directory with the sas executable (sas.exe) to the end of the PATH
like this:
<p><b>PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/shellscripts:/cygdrive/c/PROGRA~1/SASINS~1/SAS/v8</b>
<p>Note that because Unix will not accept spaces in directory names, you
have to use the pure DOS notation for some of the directories. You can
see that I have done this for "Program Files" and "SAS Institute".
<h2>
Running SAS in batch</h2>
Some of the shell scripts on this site run SAS in batch. It is supposed
to be done discretely so that the user is not aware that they are running
sas. In order to suppress the pop-up windows you get with PC sas then you
can disable them using the following options:
<p><b>sas -nosplash -nologo -icon</b>
<p>When you call sas in one of your scripts then set these options to suppress
the windows. I do not know of a shorthand way of doing this. There is no
point setting up an alias in your .bashrc as this will not get exported
to any sub-processes like you get for a shell script.
<p>The second problem running SAS in batch is that it will have is locating
the program files. Your PC sas will not understand the Unix directory structure.
It will expect a DOS file name. The scripts I write that call SAS, generate
program code in my home directory and then invokes SAS to run the code.
I have set up a HOMEW variable in my .bashrc and exported it so that I
can use it in shell scripts.
<p><b>HOMEW=C:\\\cygwin\\\home\\\Default\\</b>
<br><b>export HOMEW</b>
<p>In the shell script I then use $HOMEW as both the destination of the
log and to indicate where the program code is stored.
<p><b># Run the SAS code</b>
<br><b>sas -nosplash -nologo -icon -log "$HOMEW" -sysin "$HOMEW\contents.sas"</b>
<p>If you are developing shell scripts that call SAS on your PC and they
are intnded eventually for a Unix platform then you have to change $HOMEW
to $HOME and change the backslash to a forward slash in the program location.
You may have to remove the "-nosplash -nologo -icon" options as well.
