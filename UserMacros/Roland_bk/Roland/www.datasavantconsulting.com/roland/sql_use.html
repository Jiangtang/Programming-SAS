<h1>
SQL for Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>
<br><b>Updated: 20 Mar 2012</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
I find myself using SQL more often these days because it can keep the code
shorter and with it being less fragmented it makes my code easier to read
and understand. But sometimes the SQL syntax is not obvious and if you
can't work it out then you can end up with the SQL in fragments and so
any advantage is lost.
<p>I read somewhere that if you write SQL using SAS then it all gets turned
into data steps internally that you can not see. I don't know if this is
true but I can believe it when you consider the subject of this document
of how to derive the set of treatment emergent AEs. You will find the data
step/procedure approach is not so very different from what SQL is doing.
<h2>
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events defined</h2>
The rules for what constitutes "treatment emergent" vary from company to
company and can vary from study to study within a company but it usually
refers to AEs that happened on treatment but did not happen at baseline
<b>or</b> AEs that existed at baseline but occur again with a higher severity
on treatment. This is the definition that will be used for the purposes
of this document (although it should not be regarded as a recommendation)
to show how, using SQL, records can be excluded from one table based on
the contents of another table.
<h2>
Some Dummy AE data</h2>
First let us create some very simple dummy AE data. On-treatment will be
visit=2 or later. Pre-treatment (baseline) will be visit=1. The severity
is the number assigned to the variable SEV. The higher the number, the
more severe it is.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data ae;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=1;ae="cold";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=1;ae="cold";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=1;ae="flu ";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=1;ae="flu ";sev=2;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=1;ae="gout";sev=1;output;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=2;ae="acne";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=2;ae="cold";sev=3;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=2;ae="flu ";sev=3;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=2;ae="flu ";sev=1;output;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; pt=1;visit=3;ae="cold";sev=2;output;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=1;ae="cold";sev=2;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=1;ae="cold";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=1;ae="flu ";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=1;ae="flu ";sev=2;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=1;ae="acne";sev=1;output;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=2;ae="ache";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=2;ae="cold";sev=2;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pt=2;visit=2;ae="flu ";sev=3;output;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; pt=3;visit=2;ae="flu ";sev=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
What we expect in the Treatment Emergent Set</h2>
Looking at pt=1 then they have "acne", "cold" and "flu" on treatment. "Acne"
is definitely treatment emergent as it did not occur at baseline. As for
"cold" and "flu" then "cold", sev=3 is emergent and so is sev=2 because
the "cold" severity at baseline was sev=1. As for "flu" then sev=3 is emergent
but not the sev=2 as the maximum severity at baseline was sev=2.
<p>Looking at pt=2 then "ache" is obviously emergent but not "cold" at
sev=2 because that was the maximum value at baseline and of the two "flu"
events then the one with sev=3 is emergent but not the one with sev=2.
<p>For pt=3 then they have no events at baseline so "flu" sev=1 is emergent.
<p>Summarizing for the three patients then this is what we expect to see
(order not important) in the treatment emergent set.

2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The NON SQL way of doing things</h2>
For the baseline AEs we are only interested in the one with maximum severity
where there are two or more of the same type so we can use "proc summary"
to group the AEs by "pt ae" and take the maximum severity using the max()
function.
<p>For on-treatment AEs then we select for visit>1, sorting in the same
order we used for grouping in the proc summary step.
<p>For the last step we only want the on-treatment AEs so we use "if _b;"
in the code. Then we check to see if we got a match with the baseline AEs
and if so then we only select those with a severity greater than PRESEV.
<p>We can see the code below. It is simple code but for such a simple thing
it would be better to see it all done in one step.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc summary nway missing data=ae(where=(visit=1));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; class pt ae;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; var sev;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; output out=pre(drop=_type_ _freq_)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; max(sev)=PRESEV;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>proc sort data=ae(where=(visit>1)) out=ont;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by pt ae;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>data ont2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; merge pre(in=_a) ont(in=_b);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by pt ae;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if _b;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if _a then if sev>PRESEV;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; drop presev;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The SQL way of doing things</h2>
Using SQL we will do it all in one step and I want you to see that we are
doing it in exactly the same way, although you might not be familiar with
the syntax. Here is the SQL that does it. It will be explained piece by
piece:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; create table emerg_sql as (</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select pt, ae, visit, sev from ae as ont&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where visit>1 and not exists</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (select pt, ae, max(sev) as PRESEV from ae as pre</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where visit=1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group by pt, ae</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having pre.pt=ont.pt</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pre.ae=ont.ae</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and PRESEV GE ont.sev )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Detailed comparison of the SQL to the data steps and procedures</h2>
Look for the "proc summary" step inside the SQL. Of course we are not calling
"proc summary" but instead asking SQL to group our baseline data and pick
the highest severity. The part doing that follows. Instead of "class tp
ae;" we see "group by pt, ae". Instead of "max(sev)=PRESEV;" we see "max(sev)
as PRESEV".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (select pt, ae, max(sev) as PRESEV from ae as pre</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where visit=1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group by pt, ae</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Next you might look for the part where we sort the on-treatment data
but we have no need to sort using SQL as it will do the work of matching
up values for us. But at least we would expect to see the on-treatment
data selected. The part doing this is this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp; select pt, ae, visit, sev from ae as ont&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where visit>1&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now we need to look for the part that drops the on-treatment data if
it exists at baseline and the severity is not greater than it was at baseline.
The part that does this is below. Note that because we are grouping the
data then instead of using a "where" conditional we use "having" instead.
We don't merge "by pt ae;" but match directly using "pre.pt=ont.pt and
pre.ae=ont.ae" and in the same statement we compare the severity using
"and PRESEV GE ont.sev".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and not exists</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (select pt, ae, max(sev) as PRESEV from ae as pre</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where visit=1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group by pt, ae</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having pre.pt=ont.pt</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pre.ae=ont.ae</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and PRESEV GE ont.sev )</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen the SQL way of deriving treatment emergent AEs compared with
using data steps and procedures and have seen how the same logic and processes
are present in both methods.
