<h1>
Solid Lines with Proc Report</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>
<br><b>Updated: 11 Dec 2011</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This page is about how best to define solid lines to "proc report" output
as a "top line" or as a first footnote. It is only applicable to <b>sas
9.2</b> and higher.
<h2>
The Problem</h2>
The problem you have is that is you use underscores to give you a solid
line in "proc report" output then the line is too low and to make your
report look right you have to skip a line underneath it. This wastes one
of the lines on your page that you could be using to display data. But
if you used a line of dashes (miinus signs or hyphens) then the line is
in the right positions but it is not solid. You see the gaps between the
dashes.
<p>What you would like is the line that "proc report" gives you if you
use the option <b>headline</b>. This gives you a solid line in the middle
height of the row which is perfect. This is the line that looks like "<tt>fffffffff</tt>"
when you copy and paste to Notepad.
<h2>
The Solution</h2>
The solution is to understand that "proc report" is using a special character
that you can use as well. It is neither a hyphen (minus sign) nor an underscore.
You can find out which character this is using my <b>%hexchars</b> macro
if you coopy and paste into Notepad and save the file somewhere. %hexchars
will reveal that this character is <b>"83"x</b> (hexadecimal) and <b>131</b>
as decimal. Knowing that you can use it in your code.
<h2>
How to code it</h2>
There are two ways of using it in your code. Either direct as the <b>"83"x</b>
hex character (suitable for a top line in proc report) or as <b>%sysfunc(byte(131))</b>
in macro code (suitable for use in a footnote).
<p>Here is how to use it in your code:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc report etc........;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- a list of column veriables with a top line defined at
the start -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; columns ( "8383"x var1 var2 var3 etc. );</tt>
<p><tt>*- a footnote that is a solid line the width of the report -;</tt>
<br><tt>footnote1 "%sysfunc(repeat(%sysfunc(byte(131)),%eval(&amp;repwidth-1)))";</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how to use the <b>"83"x</b> (decimal <b>131</b>) character
to create solid lines in proc report that are shown at mid-row height.
