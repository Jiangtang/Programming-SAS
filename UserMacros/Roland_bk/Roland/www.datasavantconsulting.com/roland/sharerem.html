      Multiprocessing using SAS can greatly speed up processing in the
      right
      circumstances but should not be used as a workaround for slow
      running SAS
      code. The strength of using multiprocessing lies in having
      computers with
      a low concurrent job occupancy that is made so by efficient code
      running
      "lean and mean". The jobs then run quickly and end quickly and the
      concurrent
      job occupancy is low. Even for a very powerful computer you will
      then have
      times, even during busy periods, where the computer is idle. You
      then have
      massive spare CPU capacity that can be exploited using
      multiprocessing
      to hugely reduce the elapsed time of your work. This will
      especially be
      appreciated for ad-hoc query work running on large amounts of
      data. Conversely,
      if you try using multiprocessing in a computer running inefficient
      code,
      then the effect it has is to increase CPU overheads through having
      too
      many tasks to manage and limits for resources might be exceeded,
      causing
      delays or even job failures.
    </font>
    <p><font color="#663366">You should only be using multiprocessing to
        seek to gain a speed advantage
        if your SAS code is already running at a throughput rate of <b>10,000
          obs
          per second</b> or more. If you are failing to achieve these
        speeds then
        your SAS code needs to be redesigned in a way to give you more
        speed. If
        you are not achieving a throughput rate of 10,000 obs per second
        then you
        should apply the speed tips on the following page and return to
        this page

    <h2>
      Introduction</h2>
    If you are trying to speed up your processing using multiple <b>rsubmit</b>
    blocks then you are maybe creating <b>datasets</b> in your local
    session,
    maybe with <b>formats</b> that were defined in your local session
    and maybe
    locally defined <b>macros</b> as well and you would like these to
    be accessible
    to your remote session. This page tells you how to do this.
    <h2>
      Checking that SAS/CONNECT is licensed</h2>
    When developing code that uses multiprocessing it is wise to code in
    such
    a way that it works independently of whether the computer running
    the code
    has SAS/CONNECT licensed or not. You can test this with <b>%SYSPROD(connect)</b>
    and if it returns <b>1</b> then SAS/CONNECT is licensed to run on
    that
    machine and multiprocessing is possible. Since you will most likely
    be
    giving rsubmit processes names and "<b>wait</b>"ing for them then it
    is
    not enough to follow the recommendations on the SAS Support website
    (see
    use of the "star" macro variable on <a
href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/connref/61908/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001584568.htm"
      target="_blank">this
      page</a>). You should instead aim to test for <b>%sysprod(connect)
      EQ 1</b>
    and that would mean turning your code into a macro so you could use
    the
    <b>%IF</b>
    condition which is not allowed in normal SAS code. To make your code
    work
    independently of whether SAS/CONNECT is licensed or not is
    especially important
    if you are working in Clinical Reporting and your code is sent to a
    client
    or a regulatory authority that might have SAS licensed but not
    SAS/CONNECT
    licensed.
    <p>An alternative to coding with %sysprod(connect) is to use the
      macro
      <a href="Spectre/utilmacros/rsubmitter.sas" target="_blank">%rsubmitter</a>
      to submit multiple tasks which will work in both cases where
      SAS/CONNECT
      is licensed or not.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Sharing datasets and formats</h2>
    Sharing <b>datasets</b> is the easiest thing to do. You have an <b>inheritlib</b>
    option when you call your rsubmit and you can supply a list of
    librefs
    and what to call them in your remote session. Suppose you want the
    remote
    session to be able to access some of your <b>WORK</b> datasets
    (that will
    no doubt be mapped to a very fast memory card). Your remote session
    can't
    refer to them as being in the library WORK, since it will have its
    own
    library of that name, but you could give that library a different
    name
    like <b>LWORK</b> using the inheritlib option like this:&nbsp; <b>inheritlib(work=lwork)</b>
    so suppose you had a dataset in your local session named WORK.CLASS
    then
    in the remote session you could access it as LWORK.CLASS.
    <p>Sharing local <b>formats</b> is also easy. These will be in your
      work
      library as the catalog WORK.FORMATS. If your WORK library is
      inherited
      as the LWORK library, as in the datasets example above in this
      same section,
      then all you need to do to make these formats available in your
      remote
      session is to declare them to the format search path as <b>fmtsearch=(lwork.formats)</b>
      .
    </p>
    <p>I use a little macro to check for the existence of the LWORK
      libref
      and to change the value of the source library and to put
      LWORK.FORMATS
      on the search path if found. You can see this macro if you click
      here <a href="Spectre/utilmacros/look4lwork.sas" target="_blank">%look4lwork</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Sharing your SASAUTOS option value</h2>
    If your SASAUTOS option value is set in your autoexec file when you
    sign
    on and you are happy for the remote session to be using that same
    autoexec
    file when it starts up then there is no need to do anything. So long
    as
    you are not invoking sas using the -noautoexec option then the
    session
    will use that same autoexec and set the SASAUTOS option value for
    the remote
    session the same as it did for your local session. But if your
    SASAUTOS
    value was not set in the autoexec or maybe you do not want the
    remote session
    to use that autoexec file (maybe it does a lot of processing that
    does
    not need to be repeated) then you can explicitly pass your SASAUTOS
    option
    value to the process you are invoking. <b>But here you have to be a
      little
      bit careful.</b> You will almost certainly be invoking a remote
    sas session
    as a double quoted string in this case, such that you can resolve
    your
    SASAUTOS value using <b>%sysfunc(getoption(sasautos))</b> inside
    the double
    quoted string, <b>but</b> this SASAUTOS value of yours might itself
    contain
    double quotes around some file names you defined to it. So in these
    cases
    you have to put the SASAUTOS option value through a process to <b>translate
double
      quotes to single quotes</b>. There is a very simple macro that you
    can download from this web site named <a
      href="Spectre/utilmacros/mysasautos.sas" target="_blank">%mysasautos</a>
    to do that for you.

            <td><tt>rsubmit wait=no process1 sascmd="!sascmd -sasuser
                work -nonotes
                -nosplash";</tt></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>

    <h2>
      Sharing locally compiled macros</h2>
    Sharing locally compiled macros with your remote sessions requires a
    bit
    more work. Your locally compiled macros are stored in the catalog <b>WORK.SASMACR</b>
    and the problem here is that there is an <b>exclusive lock</b> on
    that
    file. It can not even be<b> read</b> by another session, even if you
    wanted
    it to and even though it was you who spawned that remote session.
    And there
    is no way you can free that lock in your local SAS session using a "<b>lock

...
      clear</b>" statement. But this <b>exclusive lock</b> is only held
    on
    <b>WORK.SASMACR</b> and not all catalogs, not even another one named
    <b>SASMACR</b>, so you can copy the macros you want to another <b>SASMACR</b>
    catalog and then we can make that catalog avaialble to the remote
    session.
    You probably only want selected macros to be available to the remote
    sessions
    in any case so this is not inconvenient extra work. So a libref in
    the
    local session needs to be set up and the desired compiled macros
    copied
    to a catalog
    <b>SASMACR</b> in that libref and they we can pass that libref
    across to the remote session in the <b>inheritlib()</b> option.
    Inside
    the remote session we can then declare that macro catalog to <b>SASMSTORE</b>.
    <h2>
      An Example</h2>
    This is quite a full example. It shows how WORK datasets and local
    formats
    can be shared and how selected compiled macros are copied to a
    different
    catalog and passed across to the remote session. We want a simple
    locally
    defined macro named %PRT to be used in the remote session to print a
    dataset
    in the local session using a format defined in the local session.
    The code
    and its log follow.
