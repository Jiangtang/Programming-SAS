<b>[last updated - 28 July 2003]</b>
<p>This is an <b>nawk</b> (new awk) implementation of the macro I wrote
of the same name to add <b>"Page x of Y"</b> labels to output. You can
view the SAS macro that does this <a href="pagexofy.sas">here</a>. You
are going to see that with <b>nawk</b> it is a lot shorter and when you
run it you will find it is a lot faster. Now a word of warning, there are
a number of versions of awk. Nawk is one of them. There is <b>gawk</b>
as well which is what I am using on my PC. If you are not running on a
full-blown Unix system then you might not have nawk. You might have gawk
or awk. And they have slightly different syntax. For gawk, when you reference
external variables to gawk, you must enclose those variable references
with a sequence of differing quotes as shown in the script code below for
the gawk block. For nawk it is different - you don't need to surround the
single quotes with double quotes.
<p>Whatever you choose, the utility will want access to the function gsub()
to globally substitute ann 'FE'x (\xfe) characters with a space. I use
this non-printable character at the end of a string using proc report so
that when I use a column header alignment of center or right, the information
in the columns doesn't get shifted. It is what I call a "substitute space"
and I choose 'FE'x (\xfe in Unix notation) for this. So when I add page
numbers to output I check for this character and substitute a space for
it when I find it. This utility will do the same if it can. But the function
gsub() that it uses to do this may not be in your implementation of awk/nawk/gawk.
If you work on a full-blown Unix site then you will have nawk so it should
work.
<p>If you can not get the gsub() to work because it is not available then
all is not lost. If you have carefully read the Unix tips here sequentially
then you are already in a position to be able to amend these scripts. You
can always use the <b>tr</b> utility to substitute the 'FE'x for a space
(\xfe in Unix notation). I've already introduced <b>tr</b> to you. Twice,
in fact. So you should be able to amend the script to use it if you have
to. Also, if you never use a substitute space like I do, then you can delete
the line with the gsub() call in it and it should work.
<p>I'll remind you how the original SAS macro worked. It doesn't bother
counting page throw characters. There is a target character (by default
'FF'x or \xff) where you want the "Page x of Y" label to go so it assumes
you have one of these per page and counts those instead. You'll see a few
features in the following script that I have not introduced before.

# Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 28 July 2003

# Purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : To add "Page x of Y" labels to report output
# SubScripts : none
# Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : The "page x of Y" label gets added where the target character
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'FF'x is found. In addition, if any characters 'FE'x are found
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the spaces will be substituted for them.

The header and check for parameters you should know about. But the first
line of code that follows is something I have not introduced before. Here
it is on its own:
<p><b><tt>totpages=`awk '/\xff/' $1 | wc -l`</tt></b>
<p>The first thing to note is the quotes. The quotes on the extreme left
and right are not the single quotes you normally use. They are the strange
quotes you have at the top left of your keyboard. I call them "do it now"
quotes. It will execute whatever is inside it and return the results to
the variable. Inside the quotes there is a call to awk immediately followed
by a pattern to match. That pattern is defined as <b><tt>'/\xff/'</tt></b>
and you can see that this pattern is enclosed in normal single quotes.
What this is doing is selecting only those lines that have this pattern
in it. These are the target characters for the "Page x of Y" labels. So
it is selecting only those and piping it to the <b>wc</b> utility. This
is the "word count" utility. But because the <b>-l</b> option is used with
wc it counts the number of lines rather than words. So the number of lines
with our "Page x of Y" target character in gets assigned to the variable
totpages. This the total number of pages (at least it should be if you
have put one of these target characters on each page). We resolve that
value in our call to nawk/gawk. If you use nawk then totpages gets referred
to as <b><tt>'$totpages'</tt></b> but if you use gawk then it gets referred
to as <b><tt>"'"$totpages"'"</tt></b> . If it finds the target character
at the start of a line then the "Page x of Y" label will start from that
point but it the target character is at the end of the line then it will
start earlier in the line and end on that character. But if that target
character is not there it will just print out the existing line.
<p>Needless to say, output goes to the terminal window. It is up to you
to redirect output to a file.
