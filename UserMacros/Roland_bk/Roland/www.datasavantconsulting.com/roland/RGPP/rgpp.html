Roland's Graphical Patient Profiler (v4.0)</h1></center>
<b>[last updated: 15 May 2011]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The title of this page is "<b>Roland's Graphical Patient Profiler</b>".
I'll explain what this means. To put it into context, it is to do with
<b>patients
and their progress on a clinical trial</b>. Taking the first word "Roland"
-- that's the guy who wrote this thing called a "graphical patient profiler".
<b>It's
me!</b> So that's the first word cleared up. And as for the rest of it,
the "graphical" part means "pretty pictures", if you like, so combined
with what's left, "patient profiler", it means <b>something I wrote</b>
so that you can see <b>pretty pictures</b> of <b>what is happening to a
patient during the progress of a clinical trial.</b>
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/RGPP/P01-701-1015.html" target="_blank">example rgpp output</a>
<p>The full explanation about the patient profiler will be given on seven
pages starting with this one, and they should be read in the order given.
The following page can be linked to at the bottom of the previous page.
The first page (this one) will explain what RGPP is and you will be able
to download it and play with it. The second page will tell you how to improve
layout of demography ites. The third page will show you how to transform
your data into a format that the patient profiler can use. The fourth page
will give a practical demonstration of transforming CDISC data into the
RGPP format (which created the example you can link to above). The fifth
page will explain how you can enhance your output to include graphical
legends in pop-up widows so that where you have color-coded certain things,
the explanation of the colors can be made to appear. The sixth page will
explain how I expect you to set up your html for viewing the patient profiler
output. The seventh page will set out my vision for RGPP. You can link
to these other pages below, but I must stress that it is <b>important that
you have read and understood the previous pages</b>.

<h2>
"html" pages</h2>
This page you are looking at now is an "html" page. The page above you
linked to was also an html page. "Html" stands for "hyper-text markup language"
but you don't have to worry about what that means. All you need to know
is that it is a common format for use over the Internet or <i>Intranet
</i>(for
where a company has their own collection of web sites that they don't want
outsiders to see). The dummy patient profile page you linked to above was
an "html" page that referred to a "gif" file. A "gif" file is a type of
image file. You have probably heard of "jpegs" - that's what your digital
camera creates. "Gifs" are image files that are commonly used for graphical
diagrams and this is applicable to patient profiles. "Html" pages and "gif"
images are very easy to distribute or allow access to. Clinicians following
the progress of a clinical trial will be able to log onto their local Intranet
and it is easily possible for patient profile graphics to be made available
to them. If need be, an "html" page with its associated "gif" file could
be emailed to anybody who needed it. In short - it is very easy to distribute
or make available graphical html files. Giving access to or sending graphical
patient profiles to clinicians will be simplicity itself if this format
is used. It is this style of output that will be created using my Patient
Profiler.
<p>Another thing about html pages is that you can hide messages behind
shapes, text and pictures. If you move your cursor (mouse pointer) over
a shape, text or pictures then you can see this text behind it, if there
is any put there. Again, my patient profiler is aimed to fully exploit
that ability. People using it will be strongly encouraged to put full detail
in text form behind every object shown. So a bar that shows the period
an AE lasts will give extra details about the AE such as its system organ
class, its severity, whether it is considered serious or not plus any other
information a clinician needs to see, providing that data is recorded.
The same for Vital Signs or Lab values, even if these are shown as numeric
values on the chart. The same for drug dosing. So lurking behind every
representation of data, either in text or shape form, it is intended to
put fuller details so that a clinician just has to "mouse over" it to get
more details.
<p>Now before we leave this section I would ask you to click on the dummy
patient profile above and mouse over the shapes and values displayed. Apart
from the demography details, all the other text values shown in the timescale
region and the shapes have more text behind it. Mouse over each one and
you will see.
<p>The graphical patient profiler is aimed for <b>viewing</b> and not for
<b>printing</b>.
If it is printed out then not only will it be less clear but the information
hiding behind the values will be lost. So this is not something to be printed
and faxed to somebody. Instead, you can email the html page and its related
gif to people who need to see it. They will then have the full "picture"
and be able to see the text behind the values as well. Remember that html
format is easy to distribute. People don't have to be logged onto a server
to see it because you can email it to them. But, of course, you should
treat this sort of information as confidential and be careful who you send
it to.
<h2>
What data does it work on?</h2>
You might be wondering what sort of data the patient profiler needs to
work on. The answer is <b>any sort of data</b> but there is a proviso that
will be explained. It can be <b>raw data</b> that is not clean. In can
be <b>derived data</b> that has been cleaned. It does not matter. But whatever
data you have, <b>has to be transformed</b> into data the patient profiler
can understand. This can be a lot of work but oncen done then the code
can hopefully be reused on other studies. Transforming the data is a lot
of bother but it is unavoidable. Putting displays of extra data behind
the values and shapes takes a lot of preparation and can't be done automatically.
You may choose to display values using different colors and this will not
be something that is in your original data. You may choose to display values
using a mixture of different letter heights. Again, this is not something
to be found in study data. So you have some transforming of data to do
to get the patient profiler to work and when you do this the first time
it will take a lot of coding effort.
<h2>
The four patient profiler datasets</h2>
For the patient profiler to work, it requires four datasets that must be
named exactly as stated below. Their structure will be explained shortly
but first I will list them and say what they do.
<p>There will be a dataset with only <b>one observation</b> in it that
contains the style settings for the patient profiler that controls the
general layout and colors and the default scale spacing to use. This dataset
is named <b>rgpp_style</b>. This dataset has many variables and takes a
while to set up but once set, can be used without change on all clinical
trials. It holds the unchanging values that dictate the patient profiler
layout style that is intended for use throughout an organisation without
alteration. If you are used to using sas macros then you should think of
this dataset as a "macro parameter dataset". In fact, the contents of this
dataset will be converted to effective macro parameters by the patient
profiler.
<p>There will be a dataset with only <b>one observation</b> in it that
contains the global values for a run of the graphical patient profiler.
You would put the name of the patient variable in this, the folder destination
for the html pages and gif files produced and the scale you want to display.
This dataset is named <b>rgpp_global</b>. If you are used to using sas
macros then you should think of this dataset as a "macro parameter dataset".
In fact, the contents of this dataset will be converted to effective macro
parameters by the patient profiler.
<p>There will be a dataset with <b>one observation per patient</b> (subject).
This will contain the subject identity, the html file name, the gif image
name and the start and end days for the data you want selected for a patient
and the start and end days to show on the scale. This dataset is named
<b>rgpp_patients</b>.
<p>Lastly, there is the data you want to display. There will be <b>multiple
observations per patient</b>. This dataset should be is named <b>rgpp_data</b>.
<p>In the following sections, the structure of each of these datasets will
be explained.
<h2>
rgpp_style</h2>
This is the dataset that controls the general layout for the patient profiler
display. This dataset has a lot of variables that control the layout style.
You are expected to use one layout style only throughout an organisation.
Once the layout has been decided upon, this dataset is intended for use
throughout an organisation with <b>no changes</b> being made to it so that
the style of the reports is uniform throughout the organisation. The sas
programmer who sets this up is expected to know something of sas graphics,
especially in regard to choosing the values of <b>ypixels</b>, <b>xpixels</b>,
<b>vpos</b>
and <b>hpos</b>.
<p>You can tailor the display of the patient profiler to get it to look
how you want. You can choose colors and fonts. You can choose the size
of the html page. You can choose how much of it you want to use for the
time display area and how much to leave for text on the left. What I will
say at this point is that you are required to choose some colors and because
of the way sas works, your <b>color names</b> must not be more than <b>eight
characters</b> long. This does not mean you are limited to colors with
names that are eight characters long or less. Any and every color in existence
can be referred to as an eight character name once you know how. So if
you wanted to use <b>AntiqueWhite</b> as a background then you can use
it. If you wanted to use <b>DarkSlateBlue</b> as the default text color
then you can use that as well. You just have to find out how to refer to
these colors by an eight character code and use that instead. This involves
a bit of study so I have written a page on this that explains it all very
clearly that you can link to below. It will open in a new window. Keep
referring to that page to become expert on choosing colors for your sas
html displays.
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/sas_colors.html" target="_blank">sas_colors</a>
<p>Assuming you can choose whatever color you like and refer to it by an
eight character name (or less) I will continue with the description of
the rgpp_settings dataset. What you will see below is an example of it
with settings filled in. Note that this is sas code you can use. You can
changes the settings but you must not change the length of the variables
or change their type. The variable declarations must not be changed. Just
their values. And you must make sure that numeric variables and given numeric
values and character variable are given character values that do not exceed
the allowed length.
<p>Note that some of the numeric variables used are of the True/False type
and should only be given the numeric value "0" or "1". 0=False, 1=True.
<p>Note that fonts declared below that are non-sas internal fonts must
be specified inside single quotes that in turn are contained in double
quotes. You are not seeing double!
<p>All heights are in "cells", if you know "goptions" and annotate datasets.
The patient profiler uses the cell reference system, rather than percentages.
This is the sas default. Using cells is much better for "long" pages such
patient profile html pages.
<p>This first dataset, with only <b>one observation</b>, has a lot of variables.
It dictates the style you want for the patient profiler output. Once this
dataset is created correctly it is intended to be used without change for
the forseeable future. You can always store this dataset somewhere, call
it with a "set" statement and override individual values in your code if
you need to. (you can run this code)

<h2>
rgpp_patients</h2>
This dataset has very few variables. <b>One observation is required for
each patient</b> you want to create a patient profile for. If a patient
is not listed in this dataset then no profile will be shown. Also, you
should ensure that data exists in the rgpp_data dataset for all the patients
you have listed in rgpp_patients. Note that you must give valid values
to these variables. Missing values are not allowed and will result in errors.
<p>The code you see below is there to help you. It <b>lists the variables
the patient profiler needs</b> and describes them. You need your subject
variable as well, as described in the code. It is not the complete code.
You will need a "set" statement for whatever dataset of patients you have
got and you will maybe merge with a dataset (or two) of day values you
need. How you do this is entirely up to you. The important thing is that
the patient profiler gets the variables it needs with specific names and
characteristics. (do not run this code)

<h2>
rgpp_data</h2>
This dataset has many variables and <b>multiple observations per patient</b>.
There is the subject variable plus a set of "block" variables and a set
of "item" variables. There are two "day" variables as well - "day1" and
"day2". A "block" is a group of items you want to display together as a
block. An "item" is the thing you want to display within that block and
will have characteristics like a height, a color, its day1 values (and
a day2 value for period data). Day values are calculated as days from first
dose. You might display the value as text or it might be a box or, for
period data, it will be a rod or an arrow. Creating this dataset is quite
a lot of work but once you have done it for one study then you should be
able to adapt it for other studies. Typically, you would create separate
datasets for each block of information. Your datasets might be called something
like demog, dosing, vitals, labs, aes, conmeds and then right at the end
you bring all these datasets together and give the collection of this data
the name rgpp_data.
<p>Once you get used to it, coding this dataset will become easy. The real
hard work will be in setting up the variable <b>itemhtml</b>. Each and
every item you display on the time scale (not "demog" type of data which
does not have a day associated with it) should have a text box that appears
when you mouse over it that states what the value is, what the parameter
or type of measure is, the units, the days since first dose and maybe many
other things. It is important to repeat whatever information is implicit
for its position on the day scale. Even if you were displaying the value
"98.4&deg;F" as text then you would still need to have this value in your
box that appears when you mouse over it.
<p>To help you code this dataset faster, you are allowed to have missing
values for things like "citemtext" and "hitemtext". In this case, the patient
profiler will use the defaults defined in the rgpp_style dataset. (do not
run this code as there is no data)

<br><tt>&nbsp; *- colors by an eight letter name or less.&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "citemline", if blank, will default to the color defined
in -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- the rgpp_style dataset which wil most likely be "black".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- This is the color of the line drawn around figures. You
can -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- set this to indicate the existence of an extra relationship
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- from that shown by the item color "citemtext". For example,
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- you could set it to "red" for an AE to indicate a possible&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- relationship to study drug whereas the figure color purely&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- indicates the severity of the AE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "witemline", if missing, will default to the width defined&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- in the rgpp_style dataset which will most likely be 1.
This -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- determines the thickness of the line drawn around figures.&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- Use 1 for a normal line, 2 for a thicker line and 3 for
a&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- very thick line.&nbsp; -;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "mitemfill" is the "map" pattern to fill the drawn shapes&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- with and this defaults to "mempty" (i.e. no pattern).
See&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- the SAS documentation for what map patterns are possible&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- and how to specify them. The recommended map pattern
is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- "m5x135". Note that for the box shape then the pattern
you&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- are using will be difficult to identify, due to the small&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- size, so you should take care using this facility to
ensure -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- nothing important is flagged by a pattern but missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "hitemtext", if left missing, will default to the height&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- defined in the rgpp_style dataset. You would typically
use&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- this to make the display of "itemtext" smaller such as
when -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- you were displaying wide text for lab values such as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- "NEGATIVE" instead of narrow lab measures such as "12.4".&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- This height value applies to text only, not shapes drawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "fitemtext", if left missing, will default to the font&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- defined in the rgpp_style dataset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "day1" is start day of event calculated as days since

<br><tt>&nbsp; *- the industry, by adding "1" to its value. It should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- strictly the event date minus date of first dose. If

<br><tt>&nbsp; *- date is first dose date then day1=0. It is not day1=1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

in a -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- position that is the percentage of the data area, ignoring&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- the date scaling. It overrides the day1 value. Using
it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- allows full control for positioning things like variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- labels and their values across the page in case you want
a&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- space-saving display of demography data. -;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "pctdata2" is the "day2" equivalent of "pctdata1" and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><tt>&nbsp; *- "day1_imp" is the flag that tells the patient profiler
if&nbsp; -;</tt>

you&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- were not sure of the date because it was a partial date,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- for example. For period data it will use an arrow head

<br><tt>&nbsp; *- overriden in the rgpp_style dataset.&nbsp; 0=no, 1=yes&nbsp;

<h2>
Running the Patient Profiler</h2>
Remember that the patient profiler is expecting to find 4 datasets and
they must be named as described. You have to prepare these datasets carefully.
The patient profiler macro is named <b>%rgpp</b> but you should note that
it relies on the utility macros and especially the <b>%rannomac</b> macro
must must be explicitly called before you can use %rgpp.
<p>When you are ready to run, you have to make sure the 4 datasets are
present and correct and that the output folder (that you defined in rgpp_global)
actually exists and is ready to receive the created html and gif files
and they you run the <b>%rgpp</b> macro like in the following very simplified
case. (do not run this code as it is just template code)
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >

<h2>
Downloading RGPP</h2>
RGPP is what I will be calling it from now on as the name is shorter. It
is a macro in the "<b>clinmacros</b>" zip file.
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/download.html">download</a>
<p>You can view the source code <a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/clinmacros/rgpp.sas" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
Playing with RGPP</h2>
On another page, I will give details on how to transform your clinical
data into a format that RGPP will accept. I will show you how to deal with
both horizontal and vertical data and set up the<b> itemhtml </b>entries
for these. That's a bit complicated. Before you do that you are encouraged
to play around the RGPP using the code below. It assumes you have set up
the stored macro catalog. It also assumes you have run the code that produced
<b>rgpp_style</b>
and written it to your sasuser library. It can be fun to play around with
RGPP and you will learn a lot about it that way (you can run this code).

<h2>
Extending RGPP</h2>
I have a small confession to make. That is, RGPP isn't <b><i>really </i></b>a
graphical patient profiler. I know I called it that - it is just easier
to think of it in that way if you encounter it for the first time. RGPP
is really a <b>graphics rendering macro</b> that I designed especially
for handling the normal requirements of patient profiles. In the four datasets
it requires, what you are basically doing in those datasets is<b><i> telling
it what to draw.</i></b> It doesn't<b><i> know </i></b>it is patient data
you are giving it. It could be <b>any</b> data you wish so long as what
RGPP can draw suits your needs. A tailor-made graphical patient profiler
will almost certainly put demography information just under the main header.
All the <b>real</b> ones I have seen do that. Mine <b><i>does not.</i></b>
The reason it does not is because I have kept it flexible so it can be
used for <b>other</b> purposes and is <b><i>not just limited to showing
patient data - one patient per page.</i></b> Once you break that mould
then an obvious and immediate extension to the idea of a patient profiler
is to have it <b><i>report on a study </i></b>such that the <b>study</b>
is the main title and the<b><i> </i>blocks are patients<i>.</i></b> For
example, the clinician might be interested in all the AEs of patients who
have had at least one serious adverse event. It is an easy matter to display
that on one page. I will give you some dummy code to do this so you can
see what the output looks like.
<p><b>Please take time to play with RGPP.</b> The more you play with it,
the more you will understand the way it works and the more uses you will
find for it. Remember my quote, "<b>RGPP is really a graphics rendering
macro</b>". After you have run the following code for yourself, I hope
you will be closer to realizing that. Two patient's AE data will be displayed
on the same page when you run the code below. I have been lazy and made
the patients AEs the same, but you can see what I mean, I hope! (you can
run this code)
