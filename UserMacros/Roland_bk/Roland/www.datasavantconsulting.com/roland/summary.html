<b>[last updated - 31 July 2003]</b>
<p>This is an exercise in using the <b>sasunixskeleton</b> script. Once
you have done this you will realise just how easy it is to create a Unix
utility that runs SAS. I will tell you exactly what to do. First generate
the script using <b>sasunixskeleton</b>. You are going to call this script
<b>summary</b>.
Edit the script. Don't bother filling in the header details as this is
just a practise. Change the Usage line so if the user has supplied less
than 2 parameters then the message <b>"Usage: summary varname dsname"</b>
is displayed. Now for the code. We are going to end up doing a proc print
so add <b>nocenter</b> to the top options line in the code. Next delete
all the SAS code after the filename _outfile.. line and put this in instead:
<pre><b>proc printto print=_outfile;
run;
proc summary missing nway data=here.$2;
&nbsp; class $1;
&nbsp; output out=summary(drop=_type_);
run;
title;
proc print data=summary;
run;</b></pre>
Next make a data directory a current directory and run it on a dataset
and you will see that it works. It's as simple as that.
<p>Now you see how easy it is, you are ready to learn more about Unix.
