<b>[last updated - 27 July 2003]</b>
<p>This is a QC'ing tool. You go to the output directory with your tables
or listings in it and type in something like <b><tt>"listempty *.lst"</tt></b>
and it will show you a list of all the files that fit this bill that are
empty. I'll go straight into the code of this utility and then explain
any features you might not have seen before. Copy and paste the code into
a member called "listempty" in your shell script library.
<pre><b>#!/bin/sh
# Script&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : listempty

The header and check for number of parameters and writing a usage message
to standard error I assume you are familiar with. If not then please refer
to the previous examples as I will only explain what follows it. The rest
of the code might be a puzzle, though. See the <b>"shift"</b> command in
the <b>"do...done"</b> loop? This is another way of performing a loop.
I'll explain...
<p>I'm going to explain about <b>shift</b>. When you type in a command
like <b><tt>"listempty *.lst"</tt></b> then the script does not see the
parameter as you typed it. Instead of the <b><tt>*.lst</tt></b> you typed
in it sees what the command interpreter gives it. This scans your command
line before anything else is allowed to see it. The command interpreter
sees <b><tt>*.lst</tt></b> and matches every file it can to it and turns
it into a list. So instead of <b><tt>*.lst</tt></b> the command interpreter
might translate it into something like <b><tt>aa.lst bb.lst cc.lst dd.lst</tt></b>
etc., depending on what files in that directory match the pattern you specified,
and this is what your shell script receives. Now think of the command you
type in as parameter <b>0</b> and that you can refer to its name as <b>$0</b>.
The first of the file names will be parameter <b>1</b> and you refer to
its contents as <b>$1</b>. The next parameter is <b>2</b> and you refer
to it as <b>$2</b>. And so on up to parameter <b>9</b> where the rest of
the parameters are all lumped together. Now what you can do is <b>shift</b>
the parameters along. When you <b>shift</b> parameters then <b>$1</b> gets
lost and <b>$2</b> becomes <b>$1</b>. You can keep doing this until none
are left. Have a look at the above code again. You see my test <b><tt>while
[ $# -gt 0 ]</tt></b>?. This is testing if the number of parameters left
are still greater than zero. In other words whether I have one or more
parameter values left to work on. This will be a file name. So then I test
whether the file contains something using <b><tt>if [ ! -s $1 ]</tt></b>
which you can think of as <b>"if not something in file named to parameter
1"</b> and if this condition is met it echoes the filename to standard
output. Then it has done its work for that file so it makes the next filename
available in position one by <b>shift</b>ing everything along one. And
it keeps doing this until nothing is left.
<p>I've used shift in this script but you would more often see it used
in a script where your first one or two parameters were not file names
but your third parameter was. You'd then assign the parameter values that
are not file names to variables and then shift until the first file name
was at position 1. You would then use the loop like the above that shifts
one along each time you are finished with a file until you were done with
all of them.
