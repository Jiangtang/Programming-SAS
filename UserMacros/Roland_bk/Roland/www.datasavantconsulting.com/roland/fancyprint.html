<h1>
Fancy Printing - ODS->html->MS Office</h1></center>
<b>[last updated: 24 Aug 2015]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
I will make a prediction about <b>ascii reports</b> as of May 2008 and
that is that this form of reporting will have been mostly phased out by
the end of 2009. At the current time, ascii reports are largely converted
to rtf - usually by a macro. You might get a better looking title and a
"Page x of Y" label as a result but it still does not look too good. You
also get "<b>in-text tables</b>" that are produced seperately that are
incorporated into a study report but these tend to look very different
from the rtf-style converted ascii tables. Some people have trouble creating
these in-text tables. There are various ways of doing it. What I have been
doing with my reporting macros <a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/clinmacros/unistats.sas" target="_blank">%unistats</a>
and <a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/clinmacros/unicatrep.sas" target="_blank">%unicatrep</a>
is to allow them to produce reports that look like "<b>fancy printer</b>"
reports suitable to both be printed as they are and also to be incorporated
as "in-text tables" into study reports. For me, it is better to have one
method for achieving both as greater consistency can be achieved.
<h2>
ODS->html->Excel</h2>
You can use ODS to produce html output using "<b>ODS html</b>". If you
know what you are doing, you can get this html output to look like "fancy
printer" output, which is to say that the output looks better than plain
ascii output even though it is just black and white reports. What most
people <b>don't know</b> is that <b>html can be read in by a number of
spreadsheets</b>. This is because html output of this sort is also tabular
output and it is easy for spreadsheets to convert them to their own internal
format. If you read in an html table using Excel, you then have the choice
of incorporating it into a <b>Word document</b>, using copy and paste,
and voil&agrave; - you have your in-text table! Alternatively, if you wanted
to, you could edit it and even save it as an html file that a browser like
Internet Explorer could read. Html and Excel spreadsheets have crossed
into each other's territory. You can use "ODS html" to create a file with
the Excel extension
<b>.xls</b> . It won't <b><i>really </i></b>be an Excel
spreadsheet, it will be html, because that is what "ODS html" gives you,
but Excel will accept it as a spreadsheet file.
<h2>
Avoiding the Excel trap</h2>
There is something annoying that Excel does that complicates the process
of reading in html tables. That is, it looks at what is in the table cell
and decides whether it is a number, a date etc. and formats it accordingly.
Suppose you have a table and that it contains cigarettes smoked per day.
It might show the ranges "01-05", "06-10" and "11-20". Excel will convert
these into the dates "01-May", "06-October" and "20-November". It will
drop trailing zeroes for numbers as well as drop leading zeroes. There
are tricks you can use to prevent this but the correct method is to tell
MS Office that the numeric fields are to be treated as text fields. This
is done when you create the html file - it is not done when you read it
in, which would be more convenient. The instruction is assigned to the
variable<b> mso-number-format</b>. The "mso" at the start is short for
"Microsoft Office". This variable is added automatically by %unistats and
%unicatrep when you create html files. It is mentioned in the header of
both macros as follows.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>/ rrb&nbsp; 08May08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
style(COLUMN)={HTMLSTYLE="mso-number-format:'\@'"} added</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to proc report call so that MS Office treats the cells as</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
text-formatted cells. The same can be achieved using</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
headtext="&lt;style> td {mso-number-format:\@}&lt;/style>"</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the ODS statement but it is hard to remember.</tt></td>

<h2>
The code</h2>
What I will show you is the code I have used to produce both an ascii file
and an html file, showing the same table. And I have copied the html file
to give it an .xls extension so you can click on it and read it into Excel.
I could have given the output file an extension of ".xls" in my code below,
if I wanted to. It would not change the contents of the file in any way
by giving it a different extension. Firstly, here is the code I ran to
produce the output.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>options ls=90;</tt>
<p><tt>proc format;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; value trtnarr&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; 1="Ambicor@(1g/day)"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; 2="Betamaxin@(500mg/day)"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; 3="No@treatment"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; value agecat&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-15="&lt;16 yrs"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 16-25=" 16 - 25 yrs"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 26-40=" 26 - 40 yrs"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 41-65=" 41 - 65 yrs"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 66-high=">65 years"&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>run;&nbsp;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>proc sort data=sasuser.demog(where=(fascd=1))&nbsp;</tt>

<h2>
ODS->html->Word</h2>
Microsoft Word can receive Excel output using copy and paste. But if we
want to do things the optimum way then we can insert an html file directly
into MS Word. It works much better that way. MS Word can understand html,
which
is hardly surprising, since you can save Word documents as html files.
Html and Word documents have crossed into each other's territory. You will
be able to see a Word document in the outputs in the next section where
I have given the document two titles and then inserted the html file created
by the above code.
<h2>
ODS html vs. ODS rtf</h2>
You may wonder why I am not using <b>ODS rtf</b> to create output to be
inserted into Word. It's for a very good reason. At the time of writing,
ODS rtf does not work as well as ODS html. And the output from ODS html
can easily be incorporated into both Excel and Word and retain the same
look as it does as html (given the right circumstances). The only downside
is that you have got to insert the html file into Word yourself.
<h2>
The output</h2>
Here is the output. There is a text file, an html file, the html file copied
and given the extension .xls and the Word document where I have inserted
the html file. For the text file, you might see a mass of "a"s in the fields
where the stats values are. This is the way some versions of browsers work.
These "a"s are the non-breaking space character "A0"x that I have used
to preserve alignment. To see this as it should then download the text
file and view using Notepad (or Blocnotes).
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/unitest2.txt" target="_blank">text</a>&nbsp; (you might have
to download this file and read it using Notepad)
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/unitest2.html" target="_blank">html</a>
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/unitest2.xls">xls</a>&nbsp; (this will only look correct in
Excel)
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/unitest2.doc">doc</a>&nbsp; (this will only look correct using
Word)
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen that "fancy printer" output can be created using "ODS html"
and that this html output can be read in by both Excel and Word where they
can look good as "in-text" tables.
