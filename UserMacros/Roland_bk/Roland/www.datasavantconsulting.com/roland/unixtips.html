<h1>
Unix tips for Clinical SAS Programmers</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 30 September 2007]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Note the title of this page. These are Unix tips especially for Clinical
SAS programmers. If you are one, like me, and all you want is some useful
shell scripts that you can use when working on Clinical trials then you
need look no further than this page. And I'll tell you when you might need
to use them as well. Sometimes there will be a shell script that you might
like to put in your shell script library. Sometimes it will just be a command
or a few combined commands that do not warrant a shell script being written.
If there is a shell script, then I will briefly describe what it is doing
in an understandable way. At some time in the future, I will add a link
to the bottom of this page where you can find out more about writing shell
scripts. But you will learn a lot from studying these examples here and
I suggest you go through all of these before getting into the more complicated
stuff. You are better off learning by example rather than making an academic
exercise out of it. It is the way of thinking you need to learn more than
anything else. Getting a feel for what should be possible and how simple
commands, combined, make it possible.
<h2>
Cygwin</h2>
Cygwin is free software that emulates Linux running on a PC (Linux is the
same as Unix as far as we SAS programmers are concerned). I highly recommend
downloading Cygwin and installing it on your personal PC so that you can
play around with Unix and learn it. Learning Unix should be a very practical
activity or you will never be good at it. You can run SAS from Unix as
well, so long as you have a version on your PC. There are a number of steps
to getting Cygwin set up correctly and calling SAS, so it has its own page
<a href="cygwin.html">here</a>.
<h2>
"Unix in a Nutshell" book and "man"</h2>
You need a good book on Unix to hand, if you work on a Unix platform, and
you want to "do" anything useful. And the book will only go so far, so
you need extra help as well. I highly recommend the O'Reilly book "Unix
in a Nutshell" as a concise source of Unix information. The book can not
cover everything but you will find you have a facility called "man" at
your Unix installation (mine is "info" instead on Cygwin). Suppose you
want to find out more about the "tr" command (mentioned in the first tip),
then at the prompt type in "man tr" and you will see more. In the following
tips and scripts, I am going to assume you know a little something about
commonly-used Unix utilities. But maybe you don't so a book would help
but "man" might be enough.
<h2>
Learning Documents</h2>
The following learning documents are fairly complete. They are copies of
the documents on the Spectre (Clinical) e-book. The links will all work
if you use the e-book but not always for the pages below. You are recommended
to download and install the Spectre (Clincal) e-book and study them there.
You will find much more there than on this page.
<p>The first document, "Common Unix commands", needs to be carefully read
and understood as it lays the foundations for all the other material. It
has taken me four years to get it in its current form so it is carefully
thought out and thorough. You should keep re-reading that document until
you understand it and can apply everything in it as it will be a waste
of time going further if you do not. It does not cover all Unix commands
but enough for you as an end-user, especially in the field of clinical
reporting on a Unix platform. Once you know everything in that single document
then you can consider yourself to be "good" with Unix as an end-user. It
might be the only document you will ever have to read, depending on how
far you want to take things.

Shell scripting tips and scripts</h2>
I have ordered the following tips so that they tend to build upon each
other. For that reason I recommend you go through them sequentially. If
I have marked any as IMPORTANT then you must not skip them or you might
not be able to understand the following ones.

"redirection" (IMPORTANT)

SAS/Unix scripts</h2>
These are scripts that invoke SAS. These have been developed under Cygwin
running on a PC and then converted to run under Unix. As a consequence,
there could be obvious errors in them that will cause them to fail under
Unix. Please help the author by emailing him if you have run this on a
full-blown Unix platform and you have found errors that cause it not to
run.

writes utilites that call SAS
