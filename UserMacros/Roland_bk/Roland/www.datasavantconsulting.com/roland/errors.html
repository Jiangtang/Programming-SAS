<h1>
Deadly errors you can make</h1></center>
<b>[This site is not connected with the SAS Institute]</b>
<p><b>[last updated - 09 September 2007]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The errors I will list here will be very few in number. They are errors
that you will likely make at some time if you do not remain alert. These
errors could have serious consequences so that is why I have described
them as "deadly errors".
<h2>
Missing "by" statement in merge</h2>
There is an option you can set to detect missing by statements in merges.
You can specify <b>mergenoby=nowarn|warn|error</b>. It might be a good
idea to always set this to <b>mergenoby=error</b> at the head of your code
but you have got to keep in mind that you might be calling standard macros
that do unusual merges and so you might get an error message coming out
of one of them. If you don't, then all well and good. Maybe you have an
autoexec that you could specify this option in or a piece of code you always
"%inc"lude at the top of every program and so you could put it in there.
If you can do this so you are sure it is there, then you will never hit
the problem I am describing next.
<p>This is one of these errors you make when working under pressure. You
are merging two datasets together. You are being very careful to have only
the variables you want in the keep lists. You make sure the "where" clause
is correct. You carefully code the rest of the data step. You run it. It
works. There are no errors or warning. You move on to the next task in
the certain knowledge that your code is correct. <b>BUT -</b> you have
forgotten the "by" statement.
<p>Take a look at this log and print. It is the simplest illustration of
this type of error. I am merging a treatment dataset with an AE dataset
but have missed out the "by" statement. Do you see any errors in the log?
Any warnings? No, there are none. The observations will be merged one on
one in this case since no "by" statement was specified. You end up with
subj=1 having two different treatment groups and subj=2 having none.

<br>&nbsp;</td>

<h2>
Using "set" instead of "merge"</h2>
You won't get any warning messages or even notes out of this error. That
is when you intend to merge datasets together but you use the "set" statement
instead of your intended "merge" statement. I made this mistake the other
day. That's what happens when you work under pressure. I check for duplicates
in datasets where I know there should be no duplicates so it was soon spotted.
Checking for duplicates in datasets you know should be unique on a key
is something you should do often in your code.
<h2>
/*.....*/ comments</h2>
I use slash-aster aster-slash comments a lot in my code to mark where sections
begin like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**************************</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Output Dataset</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **************************</tt>
<p><tt>data out.tmt(label='Treatment Log');</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set tmt;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**************************</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Next Section</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **************************/</tt>
<p><tt>proc sort data=tmt;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by tmtgrp;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above is very similar to a piece of code I wrote. Imagine my surprise
when I found no <b>tmt</b> dataset stored in my <b>out</b> library, yet
everything else worked fine. I hope you have spotted what is wrong. I missed
the ending slash off the top comment for "Output Dataset" and so the compiler
thought everything was a comment right until the ending '<b><tt>*/</tt></b>'
of the "Next Section" comment header. That way the code that outputs my
<b>tmt</b>
dataset doesn't get run.
<h2>
Existing "in" variable in merge</h2>
You realize the importance of using meaningful variable names so you assign
meaningful names to the "in" statement when you are merging your two datasets.
So let us look at a corrected version of the code above and its log and
print.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>77</tt>
<br><tt>78 data bad;</tt>
<br><tt>79 merge tmt(in=tmt) aes(in=aes);</tt>
<br><tt>80 by subj;</tt>
<br><tt>81 if tmt and aes;</tt>
<br><tt>82 run;</tt>
<p><tt>NOTE: The variable tmt exists on an input data set, but was also
specified in an I/O statement option. The variable will not be included
on any output data set.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: There were 2 observations read from the data set WORK.TMT.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: There were 3 observations read from the data set WORK.AES.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: The data set WORK.BAD has 1 observations and 2 variables.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: DATA statement used: real time 0.05 seconds</tt>
<p><tt>83</tt>
<br><tt>84 options nocenter;</tt>
<br><tt>85 proc print data=bad;</tt>
<br><tt>86 run;</tt>
<p><tt>NOTE: There were 1 observations read from the data set WORK.BAD.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: PROCEDURE PRINT used: real time 0.04 seconds</tt>
<p><tt>Obs subj ae</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp; flu</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Do you see that the treatment variable is missing from the output dataset
and that there is only one observation? Look at that first NOTE in the
log after the merge. The situation now is not as bad as it used to be.
In former times the treatment variable will still have been there on the
output dataset and you would have not got a NOTE to that effect. So if
you make this error these days it will be spotted. If you look at the code
written by old-time SAS programmers you will see some of them put an underscore
as the first character of the variable defined to the "in" statement, the
assumption being that nobody would have put a variable in a dataset that
starts with an underscore so no clash could occur. It is to get round this
problem that used to be so damaging in the past. But this problem of declaring
a flag variable that already exists occurs again and again in another form
as in the next example.
<h2>
"Flag" variables in data steps</h2>
I have seen examples of code in data steps where the logic has become quite
convoluted and a "flag" variable is set and changed. It is often called
"flag" as well so that it is clear that this is a flag variable. But what
appears in that output dataset is scientifically impossible in that it
defies all logic. You look at the data step code again and again. You maybe
write out examples using paper and pencil. Still the output defies all
logic. You go for a cup of coffee to clear your head. You go to lunch,
maybe, to give yourself the energy to tackle it anew. You come back to
it refreshed and replenished and it <b>STILL</b> doesn't make any sense.
<p>Well what has happened is that good ideas tend to be reused. Either
the same programmer or a different programmer also thought it would be
a good idea to use a "flag" variable in a data step. But they didn't think
to drop it from the output dataset. So the flag variable is already in
the input dataset. With each observation you are reading you could be resetting
your flag variable. And <b>THIS</b> is why the output dataset is not as
you expected it to be.
<p>If you are lucky then this problem will just drive you mad and stop
you making further progress until you have spotted the problem.
<h2>
"Fixing" data during a merge</h2>
Very rarely something so unusual happens with the data that the only way
you can handle it is to "fix" the data in the code. It vary rarely happens
that a subject can end up in the wrong treatment arm and experience a recorded
event while under treatment in that wrong treatment arm. And when you come
to do the safety tables you need to assign that event to the correct treatment
arm. So to do this you reset the treatment arm for just that one subject
and their one event. And because you are mindful of efficiency and because
that dataset is huge you don't waste processing time by doing this in a
following data step. You do it in the merge itself.
<p>I've kept this example as simple as possible. Take a look at the following
log and the print.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>87 data tmt;</tt>
<br><tt>88 subj=1;tmtarm='On drug';output;</tt>
<br><tt>89 subj=2;tmtarm='Placebo';output;</tt>

<br><tt>95 subj=1;ae='cold';output;</tt>
<br><tt>96 subj=1;ae='vomiting';output;</tt>
<br><tt>97 subj=1;ae='death';output;</tt>
<br><tt>98 subj=2;ae='flu';output;</tt>
<br><tt>99 run;</tt>

<br><tt>102 merge tmt(in=_tmt) aes(in=_aes);</tt>
<br><tt>103 by subj;</tt>
<br><tt>104 if _tmt and _aes;</tt>
<br><tt>105 if subj EQ 1 and ae='cold' then tmtarm='Placebo'; /* data fix
*/</tt>
<br><tt>106 run;</tt>
<p><tt>NOTE: There were 2 observations read from the data set WORK.TMT.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: There were 5 observations read from the data set WORK.AES.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: The data set WORK.BAD has 5 observations and 3 variables.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: DATA statement used: real time 0.10 seconds</tt>
<p><tt>107</tt>
<br><tt>108 options nocenter;</tt>
<br><tt>109 proc print data=bad;</tt>
<br><tt>110 run;</tt>
<p><tt>NOTE: There were 5 observations read from the data set WORK.BAD.</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: PROCEDURE PRINT used: real time 0.00 seconds</tt>
<p><tt>Obs subj tmtarm&nbsp; ae</tt>
<p><tt>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; On drug cough</tt>
<br><tt>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Placebo cold</tt>
<br><tt>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Placebo vomitting</tt>
<br><tt>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Placebo death</tt>
<br><tt>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp; Placebo flu</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you look at the above you will see that although it was intended
to move subj=1 ae of "cold" to the placebo group only, this setting has
remained for the following aes. "Vomiting" and "death" are now in the Placebo
arm when they should have been in the "On Drug" arm.
<h2>
Averaging averages</h2>
The following error is sometimes made and when spotted, results in tables
being reissued and resent. The error is in averaging averages. Even statisticians
trip up on this one. Let us take daily dose as an example. You have to
produce a table showing the average daily dose. You have a week at the
start of the trial at half dose and then two two-week periods on full dose.
Let us say that in the first week the subjects took one tablet a day and
in the following two two-week periods they took two tablets a day until
they stopped. So is the average dose (1+2+2)/3 ? No, it is not, because
the period on half dose was half of that on full dose. Also, suppose some
subjects dropped out of the final two week period. Their time on half dose
would play a bigger part. The proper way to calculate it is to divide the
total number of tablets taken by the total number of days. So suppose you
have correctly calculated this average for each subject by dividing the
number of tablets by the number of days on trial. So then you average all
these values for each subject to give you your final result. Is that right?
No, it is not. It is averaging averages again. To get the correct result
you would have to divide the number of tablets taken by all subjects and
divide by the number of days on trial added up for all subjects.
<h2>
Merging in Key Variables</h2>
It seems to be common practice to build Data Marts these days. These have
important key variables merged in with the data. Typically, there would
be a standard macro to do a final merging in of these key variables with
the rest of your data just before the data gets written to a Data Mart.
But there is a <b>big trap</b> here. You must make sure you are using the
fields from the correct dataset. You should always assume the programmer
might have merged in some of these fields already and even changed the
contents. You have to make sure you drop these if they exist. The safest
way to achieve this is to do an SQL join and make sure your key dataset
is the first one. SQL will only accept the contents from the first table
and issue a warning when it finds duplicate variables in the second table.
But these SQL warnings are annoying. Warnings need to be checked out in
case there is a real problem. But so many programmers have difficulty with
SQL that these warnings can really throw them. They think something is
maybe wrong with the utlity that is merging in these key fields. So to
keep people happy, this final merge of key variables might have been coded
as a data step merge. But that check for duplicate variables had better
be in there, checking for and dropping these duplicate variables.
<p>I've written a utility macro to do this and wanted to keep this checking
and dropping of duplicate variables as thorough and neat as possible. I
came up with a solution I was very pleased with. It is applied directly
to the code in the merge step. What it does is identify the duplicate variables
that are not in a list of variables you are going to merge by and you use
this list in a drop statement applied to the second dataset. The macro
that detects these duplicate variables is called %duplvars and to see this
