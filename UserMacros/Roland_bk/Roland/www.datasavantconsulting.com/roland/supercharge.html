<h1>
Supercharge your Clinical Reporting Function</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 01 Oct 2008]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
One of my hobbies is f&icirc;nding ways to improve the efficiency of clinical
reporting systems. This is a natural progression for when I once wrote
a clinical reporting system I named "Spectre (Clinical)" that you can download
from this web site (see main page). After I had written the system and
it was in full use, then as a new system, the programmers working on it
were able to produce 8 tables per day. This was high-pressure work. A more
realistic total would have been 6 tables per day for all-year-round working
so that is the figure I will use. I stress that <b>this total of 6 tables
per day </b>was for a<b> new system</b>. Because the system was new then
there were no code members lying around that we could copy and amend nor
any macros to help us. There were no short-cuts we could use. We had to
program from scratch. But in programming all tables from scratch we would
find that some tables were similar to ones we had recently programmed and
so long as we were aware of which program produced similar output then
a copy of this program could form the basis of the new program. So, <b>does
6 tables per day represent good efficiency or less than good efficiency?</b>
Well, I have heard of clinical reporting systems that have cost a lot of
money to design and write. In two cases I know that the productivity rate
expected through use of the system was <b>3 tables per day</b>. So I have
achieved double that efficiency at a fraction of the cost. So, <b>am I
proud of my achievement of 6 tables per day?</b> I'll tell you that <b>I
am not</b>. I was hoping for <b>10 tables per day</b>. It fell short of
my hoped-for total and for a long time I tried to think of ways of improving
my system to increase its efficiency. But now I have stopped trying. I
have found a way to improve efficiency but it is not by changing my reporting
system itself, which I now think might be optimal as it stands, but by
optimising the reuse of code already written. In this way, I hope to push
the limits of tables per programmer day way beyond the 10 tables target.
<h2>
Reuse of code</h2>
Suppose you could very quickly know where a code member existed that could
produce the same or nearly the same as the table you wanted to create,
and that you knew that this was good code that had at least been peer reviewed
if not validated. It would then make a lot of sense for you to copy this
code member and make whatever amendments were required to make it suitable
for the study you are currently working on. But there are two big "<b>if</b>"s
in that. <b>IF</b> you know where to look for the code and <b>IF</b> you
know it is good code. If these two big "<b>if</b>"s were fulfilled then
you would be crazy to program from scratch unless it turned out that no
such output had been produced before and therefore were no code members
you could copy and amend.
<p>Think about this: Suppose you were several years down the line and every
table you were asked to produce had already been produced before, either
identical or nearly the same, and you could copy and use that code member.
Suppose all these code member were perfectly written according to programming
standards in such a way that it was easy to amend these programs for the
study you were now working on. How many tables per day do you think you
could produce on that basis? I think you could see that in ideal circumstances
this could be a high number. Supposing you don't want to get stressed then
what is a reasonable steady rate of tables you could produce a day with
such a system in place? Now I don't want to stress you by suggesting 20
tables per day but I think you will agree that 10 tables per day would
be reasonable for even a programmer with limited experience. Maybe a fast
and expereinced programmer who knew the system well could achieve 20 tables
per day. That would be double the target I had hoped for from my reporting
system. But consider this: <b>It does not matter how bad the reporting
system is</b>. With such a system of reusing code then so long as you were
sure the code was good then if a poor clinical reporting system was in
use then it would only slow you down to a small degree compared with a
good reporting system. With a poor reporting system you would maybe need
to amend the code in more places compared to if a good reporting system
were being used. That might only take you a few minutes more even in the
worst case. In most cases it would make no difference.
<p><b>The key to improved efficiency in clinical reporting is the easy
availability of good code to reuse.</b> The quality of the reporting system
itself is only of secondary importance.
<h2>
A Template Library</h2>
My solution to the two big "if"s I mentioned in the previous section is
to <b>build and maintain a template library</b>. This library should contain
output and code. The output would be a single page with the numeric digits
turned into "x"s and with the study title maybe also obscured with "x"s
so that it looked like a template (this could be done using the "digits2x"
utility script that comes with Spectre). With it would go a code member.
Not just a code member copied directly from another study but one that
was carefully written and reviewed. It's header might have blanks for you
to fill in study details. Its data selection criteria might be highlighted.
I would suggest that "EDIT EDIT EDIT" be used in places in the code where
the programmer is expected to have to make changes such that they can easily
find these places using the search facility of the editor they are using.
Suppose you had a demography table. If it were the first demography table
to be put in the template library then the template could be called <b>demog001.tmp</b>
and the code member to use could be called <b>demog001.sas</b> . This template
library would be in a known location. When study outputs are specified
then this template should be mentioned by name (excluding the ".tmp extension)
so that the programmer could go directly to that code member, copy it and
amend it. If an output were designed that was not included in the current
template list then that output could be approved such that when the reporting
process was completed then a new template for this output could be added
to the library and a new code member prepared and added.
<p>For CROs with multiple clients, it might be better for them to have
a seperate template library for each client.
<p>Note that if you had already reported an increment of a study using
this method then for later increments it would likely make more sense to
copy the existing programs you have for earlier increments into the new
increment folder and amend the programs there. This is assuming you are
providing the same set of reports or very nearly the same.
<h2>
Outsourcing clinical programming work</h2>
It is worth pointing out at this stage that if you can get high productivity
out of your current reporting environment by efficiently using a template
library then the advantages to be gained by outsourcing clinical reporting
work become less or even negative. It makes sense to aim for high efficiency
and to retain this work in-house.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
On this page I have suggested a way of improving the efficiency of clinical
reporting using a template library to achieve a rate of higher than 10
tables per programmer day.
