<h1>
Creating a scale using an annotate dataset</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
What I am going to show you on this page is one way to create a time scale
using an annotate dataset.
<h2>
annotate macros</h2>
If you are aware of <b>annotate datasets</b> then you might or might not
be aware of a set of macros called the "<b>annotate macros</b>" supplied
by the SAS Institute. They are all held inside one of the autocall members
named <b>%annomac</b>. This is unusual because normally they are single
macros with the same name as the member name. You have this macro in your
"core" sasmacro library if you look. The SAS Institute supply it. It isn't
one of mine (for a change). These annotate macros don't save you much work,
since you have to understand how annotate datasets work in their raw form
to be able to use these macros - but they can make your code shorter and
easier to understand. So long as using these macros suits the application
you are trying to write, you will probably prefer to use them rather than
use raw annotate dataset code. Of course, there is nothing to stop you
mixing raw code and calls to these macros.
<p>How to use the annotate macros has been the subject of a number of papers
and I am not going to write such a paper. You can search Google for these.
What I am going to show you on this page is a fairly complicated use of
them when creating and using a time scale.
<h2>
patient profiler time scale</h2>
What I am going to do on this page is to recreate the outline of a page
created for an example graphical patient profiler. It is the first figure
shown in the following document. You have to scroll down a bit
<br><a href="http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2007/ad/ad03.pdf" target="_blank">A
Low Cost Graphical Patient Profiler with SAS MetaViewApplet</a>
<p>Note that the scale is shown from day -40 to 150 with the scale marks
you can see at the bottom of the page. This is what I am going to reproduce
in this document. I won't be adding any other details at this stage. That
would make things too complicated. I just want you to see how I have reproduced
this scale. In my code you will see how I can plot a day number to an x
axis coordinate so if I wanted to I could add other details just like the
patient profiler is doing. But for your sake, I will keep things simple.
<h2>
The code</h2>
Note that <b>%annomac</b> has to be called so that the macros inside it
can be complied and therefore called from inside the data step. I will
be calling a few of these macros, namely <b>%dclanno, %system, %frame,
%move, %draw</b> and <b>%label</b>. Don't regard my goptions as authoritative.
I just keep changing them until it works for me. Feel free to change them
yourself. The only complicated thing about the code below is perhaps the
"drawscale" routine. This loops through the scale and calls "calcx" for
each day to work out what the "x" coordinate should be. It then writes
the scale value and draws a line in the graph area. If you want to play
around with this code then remove "dev=html" in the goptions so that you
can see the results in your output window, rather than having to look at
an html file.
