<h1>
How to Control Column Widths for Proc Report ODS Output</h1></center>
<b>[last updated: 02 June 2008]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
One of the interview questions asked of me over the years was something
like "What is it you would next like to do with SAS software". And I have
said for the past six years, "I'd like to do more work with ODS". Well,
six years have passed and I have done <b>plenty</b> of work with ODS during
that time. First, was using ODS to get hold of the datasets created by
the stats procedures. I now feel comfortable with that. Next, was controlling
the format of the output from "proc report". I now feel comfortable with
that as well, but in this case, <b>the learning curve was very steep</b>.
It took tens of hours of studying the documentation and trying things out
to get things to work correctly. I thought I had arrived late on the scene
of ODS and was expecting advice to be on sas websites all round the world.
It was not, however. Instead, I found myself almost alone on this treck.
Instead of following in well-trod footsteps, I felt like I had become a
trail-blazer. For proc report output, I tried setting up styles using proc
template and got nowhere. I will not claim I understand what "proc template"
can give you, but by the time I abandoned a study of the subject, I felt
I knew enough in that it wasn't going to give me what I needed. So I investigated
the statements that could be used with proc report and finally found what
I wanted.
<p>Eveybody will go down the proc report ODS route in the future, if you
are in the field of clinical reporting, and in the absence of good help,
will waste tens of hours in trying to learn how to achieve what they want.
That is, unless they have good help that they can find on a web site somewhere.
This is why I have written this page. "My pain will be your gain", as the
well-worn phrase goes. Actually, all this information is already on this
web site, but it is covered in different topics. This page will address
this issue of setting column width directly, and refer you to other existing
pages on this web site.
<h2>
Width=xxx doesn't seem to work</h2>
You set up proc report to give ODS output, you know you have your column
widths defined correctly for ascii reports but wonder why the column widths
are not correct for the ODS output produced. You notice that some of your
columns are a minimum width and they don't look right. Why didn't ODS honor
the column width you specified? The answer is that it relies on a different
system for column widths. It relies on the <b>cellwidth=</b> option setting
and if you don't specify it, ODS will choose the column widths itself and
will try to "squash things in" to best fit the page and minimize the total
report width. At this point in time I would like you to open the SAS online
documentation in a different browser window and search on the term "cellwidth".
What you will discover is that although you can find the word, you can
probably find out nothing on how to use this parameter. This whole topic
is extremely poorly linked in the documentation and could explain why ODS
reporting has not "taken off" as it should have done. The phrase to search
on is "Style Attributes and Their Values" and if you search on that you
will find "TEMPLATE Procedure: Creating a Style Definition Style Attributes
and Their Values". I hope the following link works for you.
<p><a href="http://support.sas.com/onlinedoc/913/getDoc/en/odsug.hlp/a003079951.htm" target="_blank">TEMPLATE
Procedure: Creating a Style Definition Style Attributes and Their Values</a>
<p>There are two attributes you need to know about for adjusting column
width in ODS. <b>Cellwidth=</b> as applied to individual columns and <b>outputwidth=</b>
as applied to the whole report.
<h2>
Using cellwidth= and outputwidth=</h2>
You can use different dimensions when you specify values for these two
attributes. I use <b>percentages</b> as I have found this to work best
for me so I will only describe percentage values here. But feel free to
experiment with the other dimensions.
<p>For <b>outputwidth=</b> , if you specify a percentage that is the report
percentage width of the output area. Obviously you can not go above 100%.
For html output, I have found that if I multiply the report width (if this
is known) by 2/3 then this gives me a good percentage width. Obviously,
if the report width were greater than 150 columns then you must not allow
your outputwidth= value to be above 100% so you will have to set 100% as
the value if you calculate a value higher than this. Suppose your report
width were 120 columns then, multiplying by 2/3, you would specify <b>outputwidth=80%</b>
. Note that percentage values must be integer values so you might have
to round it or use the %eval() function which will works with integer values
only.
<p>For <b>cellwidth=</b> values, again I supply these as percentages, but
they are <b>percentages of the report width</b> and not the output area
as for the outputwidth= used at the report level. For the individual columns
you should specify these for every column except for the widest column
which will "soak up" what is left. Again, I am assuming you know your total
report width in columns. Also, the spacing between columns. Your percentage
value is then %eval(100*(&amp;cwidth+&amp;spacing)/&amp;repwidth) assuming
you have such macro variables set up. Suppose you report width were 120
and your column width 10 columns and the spacing 2 columns then 100*(10+2)/120
would give you the value 10 and so you would specify <b>cellwidth=10%</b>
. Again, note that the value must be an integer. This is partly why I let
the widest column "soak up" the rest of the width. It's because I don't
know which way the other cell widths will round so I can't be sure what
percentage value will complete it up to 100%.
<h2>
Where to specify outputwidth= and cellwidth=</h2>
As I said, all the knowledge about setting column widths for proc report
ODS output is already on this web site, but under different topics. I have
a macro named %unistats that calls a macro %unicatrep to produce reports
of a certain type. There are a lot of ODS parameters written into the %unistats
macro that get passed through to the %unicatrep macro. I will provide a
link to the %unicatrep macro below and then you can locate the "proc report"
step and look for the outputwidth= attribute and the cellwidth= attributes
applied to each column. You will find these attributes and a lot more in
that macro. Note that in calculating percentage values for cellwidth= ,
I am assuming that cellspacing=0 which is the spacing between cells. I
recommend that you use the same setting.

<h2>
SAS v9.2 and "spanrows"</h2>
With SAS v9.2, things got a whole lot better for "proc report" ODS output
with the addition of the "<b>spanrows</b>" option that you can use with
the "proc report" statement. What this does, if in effect, is allow "group"
or "order" text to flow but without leaving a gap in the "display" lines.
This new option acts on ODS output only and is a very welcome improvement
(it has no effect on ascii output - the problem is still there). Pharmaceutical
companies will be the main beneficiaries of this new option, for their
clinical reports, when they finally move over to ODS output. Many of these
companies have not moved over to SAS v9.1.3 yet, let alone SAS v9.2, but
the benefits of skipping out on SAS v9.1.3 and upgrading directly to SAS
v9.2 would be very beneficial, in my opinion. In SAS v9.2 the graphics
and drill-down capabilities are also improved and this could add a whole
new dimension to clinical reporting, once the benefits of graphical reporting
are realized.
<p>Coming back to "<b>spanrows</b>", if you search the %unicatrep code,
that you can link to above, and search for "spanrows", you will see how
I have implemented it. It will cause a syntax error in sas versions pre-v9.2
but I have coded around that problem, as you will see.
<h2>
More to learn</h2>
There is a great deal more to learn about getting "proc report" output
to look right beyond getting columns to be the right width. You will see
a lot of attributes used in the %unicatrep macro. I recommend one of my
other sas tips pages which is below. A lot of the above information will
be repeated there.

Conclusion</h2>
This document has shown you my recommended way for controlling column widths
for "proc report" ODS output.
