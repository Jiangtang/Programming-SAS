<b>[last updated - 27 July 2003]</b>
<p>Who's got your SAS dataset? It'll be one of the QC'ers. You need to
generate a fresh set of datasets but you can't because the programs fails
and says that somebody else is holding a lock on one of your datasets.
You've got to find out who they are and ask them to free up your dataset.
I bet they're at lunch or in a meeting.
<p>Assuming you work on a full-blown Unix platform then finding out who
is holding a lock on a file you want to update is easy to do. There is
a utility program called <b>fuser</b> in the<b> /usr/sbin/</b> directory
you can use. The script to do this is very simple. It wil list out each
file you want to check on and the userids of those holding locks. And if
the identity of the person is not obvious from the userid then you can
use the getname script on this web site to find out their names.
<p>Here is the script code. Copy ans paste it into a member called whosgot
in your shell script library. There are a few features of the script that
you might not be aware of so it will be explained.
<pre><b>#!/bin/sh
# Script&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : whosgot
# Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 1.0
# Author&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Roland Rashleigh-Berry
# Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 27 July 2003
# Contact&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : rolandberry@hotmail.com
# Purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : To list users who have locks on files&nbsp;
# SubScripts : none
# Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : You can not pipe the output from this to other utilities. This&nbsp;
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will show userids holding locks on files. You can then use the
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "getname" script to match user-ids to names of people.
# Usage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : whosgot demog.sas7bdat
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whosgot *.sas*
#================================================================================
# PARAMETERS:
#-pos- -------------------------------description--------------------------------
#&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; File or list of files to check for locks held
#================================================================================
# AMENDMENT HISTORY:
# init --date-- mod-id ----------------------description-------------------------

if [ $# -lt 1 ] ; then
&nbsp; echo "Usage: whosgot *.sas*" 1>&amp;2
&nbsp; exit 1
fi

for filename in "$@" ; do
&nbsp; /usr/sbin/fuser -u $filename
done

echo "Use \"getname userid\" to identify the names of any listed userids holding locks"</b></pre>
As I mentioned for the getname script, everything following a hash is a
comment so you can see that all the header lines are comment lines. The
first line is special because the !/bin/sh defines the location of the
shell you want to use to interpret this script. Hopefully you knew that
already. At the start of the code the number of supplied parameters is
checked. If they are less than one then it implies the user needs help
with this utility so a message is written out to standard error (using
1>&amp;2 to redirect standard output to standard error) and the script
exits with a return code of 1 to warn that something small went wrong.
Next comes the "do loop". "Do" loops are very useful and they come in different
forms. This is one of them. $@ is a list of all your input parameters.
If you invoked the utility like this <b><tt>"whosgot *.sas*"</tt></b> then
the script doesn't see <b><tt>"*.sas*"</tt></b> any more. You have something
called a "command interpreter" that expands out <b><tt>*.sas*</tt></b>
into all the file names in that directory that fit the bill. So what the
script gets is this expanded-out list of files. So what the script sees
might be <b><tt>"ae.sas7bdat demog.sas7bdat elig.sas7bdat"</tt></b> etc.
The line that says <b><tt>'for filename in "$@"'</tt></b> is going to take
each entry in the list in turn and assign it to the variable filename and
will perform whatever code is defined between the "do" and "done" on it.
So each filename will get <b>/usr/sbin/fuser</b> called to check for locks
held.
<p>The <b>/usr/sbin/fuser</b> utility is what I call a "badly behaved"
utility. You can't pipe its contents out to other utilities otherwise I
might have liked to only list the files with locks against them and only
listed those with a person's full name next to them. But it didn't work
because when I pipe the output the userids are no longer there. Maybe this
will be fixed at a later date but for now it will have to stay as it is.
