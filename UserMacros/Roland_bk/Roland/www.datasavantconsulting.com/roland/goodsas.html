How to become a good SAS programmer</h1></center>
<b>Last updated: 14 Jun 2015</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Once in a while, at interviews or on an assignment, I will be asked by
somebody hoping to do SAS programming work, how that person can become
a good SAS programmer. I usually give an answer but the answer will vary
from person to person. I never have had the time to explain my reasoning
in those circumstances so I thought I would put down my thoughts on this
page. This page is not about learning syntax, what to learn or following
company programming standards as that is just part of the job. It is about
the extra attributes that it is good to have or to develop to be a good
SAS programmer.
<p>Bear in mind that just as I am asked my personal opinion, what follows
on this page is my personal opinion.
<h2>
"Born to be" programmers</h2>
There is no doubt in my mind that some people are "born to be" programmers.
You can become a good programmer without being such a person -- but if
you are it helps! If you were "born to be a programmer" then you would
have been programming on and off since you were a teenager. That is the
simple test. A "born to be" programmer will pick up programming languages
by reading manuals and trying things out. They have the patience to do
this, a technical orientation and a focussed mind for these tasks. SAS
is an easy language in comparison to what is out there so a "born to be"
programmer will have no trouble becoming good at SAS.
<h2>
A good programmer</h2>
If you are not a "born to be" programmer then do not worry, but a little
of the need for this lingers on. Note that the word "SAS" is missing from
the title of this section which is "A good programmer". This is for a reason.
In my opinion, you can not be a "good programmer" if you are a one-language
programmer. If SAS is the only language you know then, in my opinion, you
can never be good at it. A programming language is a tool to do a certain
job. Different languages do different things and can achieve different
things. Scripting languages, for example, can achieve automation and great
efficiencies on the platform you are working on and you may never do anything
vaguely mathematical in years of using these scripting languages. A "good
programmer" understands that different languages are for different purposes
and will not limit their thinking to the way they use the usual language
they work in. It is a mistake to become set in a mold as it will stop you
from seeing the greater scope and purpose of the work you do. It is better
to think freely and look around for the language to help you achieve your
goal. There is a lingering piece of "born to be" programmer at work here
though it is slight.
<h2>
Experienced programmer converting to SAS</h2>
The conversion of a programmer from using languages that do not handle
a lot of data to using SAS which does, is a difficult one. A lot of relearning
has to be done. There are usually two phases to a SAS program - pre summarization
and post summarization. The experienced programmer has to learn a dual
approach for these two phases. For pre summarization they have to learn
to use as few data fields as possible with as little processing as possible
to get the large volume of data to the summarization step in a minimum
elapsed time. After the data is summarized then the number of observations
is a lot less and so this is the stage to manipulate the data into the
form you want. The efficient handling of large volumes of data is paramount
in SAS programming. This is covered on the "<a href="speedtips.html" target="_blank">SAS
Speed Tips</a>" page.
<p>For this category of experienced programmers from other languages, it
is possible to be one of the best programmers in the world at the same
time as being one of the worst <b>SAS</b> programmers in the world if this
"dual approach" is not recognized and worked on.
<h2>
Advice to non-experienced programmers</h2>
If I recognize that somebody is already a good programmer and wants to
pick up SAS then my task is easy. I would recommend them to look at a good
SAS programmer's style and use that to guide them. After a year or so,
with a good style as their foundation, then that person will be able to
branch out with their own style. For a person who is not already a programmer
then it is more difficult. What makes it difficult is the assumptions the
aspiring programmer is making. Not being a programmer at all, they have
no grasp on what it takes to become a programmer. They will assume it is
something that can be learnt from a book. It can't and there is no such
book. There is no hidden knowledge. The aspiring programmer will have to
become one by trying out the language on examples and dummy data. They
will have to discover "right" and "wrong" ways to do things and prepare
to have their views changed as they gain experience. It is essential to
try things out otherwise you will not make progress. This will be an uphill
struggle for many aspiring programmers but if you stick to the task then
you can start becoming good after a year or so. I changed over from the
field of Capacity Planning, using SAS, to the field of clinical reporting
and it was an uphill struggle for me for the first year, even with more
than ten years SAS experience. It will be as hard for you as it was hard
for me. Patience is required. Don't push yourself too hard. Do not try
to "better" another programmer or reach their standard as a goal. You will
find your own level. Being technically brilliant is not everything. Being
able to function as part of a team is more important. This is more likely
to get you promoted to senior programmer through to Head of Programming.
Those who are very technical tread a lonely path and are often not appreciated.
My advice to non-experienced programmers who may not feel comfortable with
the technical issues of SAS is to concentrate on the team aspects of their
work.
<h2>
How much SAS should you know?</h2>
The SAS language covers a vast scope. There are areas of SAS I have not
even touched upon. There is the "object orientated" aspect of it that I
know nothing about. I have not touched many of the stats procedures and
those that I have, my knowledge of them is superficial. I used to write
SAS/AF applications but the facilities have changed greatly since I last
used it. There is SAS/IML which I only used for a day. There is ODS which
I have used a lot but there is much more. There is SAS/OR that I have never
used but it strikes me as important. Neural networking with SAS I am aware
of but have never used it. Modelling for business I have not touched and
know nothing about and there is so much more I have probably not even heard
of. I was once asked in an interview how much of the entirety of the SAS
language I could say I knew. I answered "Between 15 and 20 percent" - and
this is me with over 25 years of SAS experience doing some very technical
things over a broad range of applications. This was not a confession of
ignorance -- it was more of a boast. I would say that knowing 10% of the
SAS language is a good level to reach so long as you realize that there
is so much more and you are prepared to look beyond your limited experience
as to what the SAS language can offer you.
<h2>
Keep it simple</h2>
On a final note, my last piece of advice is to "keep it simple". I have
seen many programmers, both new and experienced programmers, code in a
complex way. Maybe they think it proves to others that they are good programmers
if they code that way. This is a bad idea. It is better to code in a way
that does not draw upon peoples mental energy who may have to maintain
your code at a later date. Included in this is commenting your code well,
maybe also splitting long code into clearly marked sections to make it
easy to understand. That way the maintainers can better understand it and
can make amendments, if required, that in turn can be maintained in the
future. On a similar note, macros should not be overused such that you
are turning things into macros where there is no good reason. If your use
of macros is not simplifying your code and instead, making it more difficult
to understand, then you are using macros incorrectly. This web site has
many tips on writing macros that can help you.
<h2>
How new programmers are giving less than before</h2>
Since I started out in programming as an industry trained programmer in
1984, the job has lost a great deal of its reputation and prestige. A major
reason for this is that computers are much cheaper than they and more computer
languages exists and it is easier to write them - so this is understandable.
But in 1984, programmers starting out in the industry were giving value
for money in what they were doing and I don't feel that programmers are
giving value for money in the present day. A programmer who is not giving
the same value for money now is not entitled to the respect nor the salary
equivalent in modern day terms as programmer were getting then. It is no
wonder that so much work is being outsourced. Programmers today are not
as good as programmers used to be in 1984 when I first started out in computing.
The situation is worsening to the extent that some companies might need
to bring some of their old programmers out of retirement to give them part
time working to make up for the skills gap in programming that now currently
exists.
<p>Here are some examples of how programmers were giving value for money
then but not now:
<ul>
<li>
New programmers learned from their team members. It was accepted that a
new programmer would be worth nothing for the first six months, would only
be able to create small things of worth after six months and only under
the supervision of the more experienced team members. And so new programmers
made the effort to learn and were appreciative of the help and advice they
got from their team members. The same applies today. New programmers need
to realize that their contributions initially are worthless and to make
the effort to learn from more experienced people. New programmers knew
that and made the effort to pick up experience. Through this effort to
learn from others they grew into better programmers and thus were, after
two years or so, able to give value for money. This is not happening any
more. New programmers are looking for quick results and think that that
is enough. But it is a bad approach because they stop learning too early.</li>

<li>
Experienced programmers made the effort to help their junior colleagues.
They should still be active in doing this if they are to give the industry
value for money. They should help other programmers and not just think
of themselves and what they know and what they think they are worth. To
create a more useful programming field for the benefit of all, they should
give freely of their knowledge (and experience if possible). Today, it
seems that the more experienced programmers want to keep their knowledge
to themselves, perhaps for competition reasons, but it makes the whole
programming field weaker if they do that, which eventually will devalue
their own work.</li>

<li>
Make up for the job getting easier. When I first started out in programming,
the job was incredibly difficult. You were expected to be able to write
fully correct and working code if not on your first attempt then your second
attempt. You might not even get any diagnostics when you compiled your
program so you just had to get it right without any help from the compiler.
If your program went wrong then a "system dump" would be printed of all
the hex codes in computer memory and you would have to work out what had
gone wrong with your code from the memory dump. It was called "dump cracking"
in those days. That was incredibly difficult and such difficult jobs working
on expensive computers were worth a good wage. If things have gotten easier
since then, then to justify the same level of wages and enjoy the same
respect, we need to do more. Maybe to think of how problems might arise
in the future and avoid them. Maybe to see a bigger picture and how things
need to fit together and plan and write computer systems accordingly. To
design and write entire computer applications rather than just individual
programs. But most programmers today do the minimum and expect the same
appreciation. Often, they do not bother to keep up to date with new features
and enhancements in the computer language they use.</li>
</ul>
