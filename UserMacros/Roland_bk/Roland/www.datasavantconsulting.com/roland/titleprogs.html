<b>[last updated - 31 July 2003]</b>
<p>You have to write this one yourself. Use <b>sasunixskeleton</b> to create
a script called <b>titleprogs</b> and then edit it. What you need is a
list of unique program name in your titles dataset written to standard
output in sorted order. <b>Don't put the ".sas" entension</b> on the end
of these program names. If your actual program names are lowercase then
this list should be lowercase as well. I later aim to match these entries
up with the actual programs in your program folders. You should be able
to run this from any directory that has your protocol and study in the
path name. Only you will know where your titles dataset is located so you
should be able to specify its location. You will maybe need to know how
to strip the protocol and study identity from your directory path as I
covered in this <a href="sed%26awk.html">tutorial</a>. I am going to use
the output from this script in my next script. The next script will compare
the program list that is output from this script to the programs you have
in your programs folders for that protocol and study. Happy scripting !
