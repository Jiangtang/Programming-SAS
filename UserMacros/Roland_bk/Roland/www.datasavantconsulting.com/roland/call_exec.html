<h1>
Use %nrstr() when you "call execute" a macro</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b>Assuming you want to call a macro specified to "call execute" after
that data step has finished then you need to mask the macro call with %nrstr()</b>
in your "call execute" code otherwise it will take effect within the data
step itself. This is mentioned in the SAS online documentation but insufficient
emphasis is given to it. Without the %nrstr() to stop it, the macro call
will be resolved internally and then, in the following step, the resolved
content of the macro (if any) will be executed instead of the macro itself.
<p>"Call execute" is difficult for many programmers to use because it is
a challenge to get the brackets balanced, remembering to use double quote
marks within single quote marks where a value needs to be quoted, remembering
to put semicolons inside quotes so that your executed code ends with a
semicolon as well as ending the call with a semicolon etc.. It is counter
to the logic you use in coding data steps and so requires a lot of thought
and practise. You can waste a lot of time getting "call execute" to work
in complex cases and time is often limited. Perhaps it would be better
if there were an alternative to "call execute" - and there is!
<p>What will be explained on this page is the problem of not using %nrstr()
and an alternative method to using "call execute".
<h2>
Background</h2>
"Call execute" used to be a non supported feature of sas 5.18 and was useful
where you wanted to avoid writing generated sas code to a fileref and then
%including it at a later point. This was because in sas 5.18 the %include
file had to be given a location, unlike now when you can define the file
as TEMP, so there was a remote possibility that this file might be changed
or deleted before the code was %included back in again and so this was
a security issue. When sas 6.02 was released, "call execute" had been dropped.
It got reinstated in sas 6.07, through user pressure, but no effort had
been made to improve ease of use of this feature.
<h2>
The problem</h2>
The following log shows the problem where %nrstr() is not used. In the
first call without %nrstr() you will see that the macro "test" prints "TWO",
which is the value assigned to "mvar" in the line above the "call execute".
But if %nrstr() is used to mask the macro call then the value "THREE" is
printed which is what you would expect if the macro were truly being executed
after the data step has ended. The macro printing "THREE" is the usual
and correct way you expect the macro to work if the macro were called after
the data step and yet you only get that by using %nrstr(). And because
the macro gets resolved internally with the %nrstr() it could be the source
of strange memory problems that can occur. An example of this might be
that sas skips over data steps in the code following the macro call. Sometimes
these problems are incomprehensible and there will be no useful diagnostics
written to the log.
<p>Look at the log below carefully and see where without %nrstr() we get
the value "TWO" but with %nrstr() we get the expected value "THREE". See
how in the first case "call execute" did not generate the line we were
expecting which would be "1 + %test;" and instead it generated "1 +;" which
means that all it generated was a semicolon. In other words, it had processed
the macro internally. But in the second case it has generated the line
we were expecting and we get the expected result.

<br><tt>98</tt>
<br><tt>99</tt>
<br><tt>100 data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>101 call symput('mvar',"TWO");</tt>
<br><tt>102 call execute('%nrstr(%test);');</tt>
<br><tt>103 call symput('mvar',"THREE");</tt>
<br><tt>104 run;</tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time):</tt>
<br><tt>real time 0.00 seconds</tt>

<p><tt>NOTE: CALL EXECUTE generated line.</tt>
<br><tt>1 + %test;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>> THREE</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here is another simple example that proves that "call execute" will
execute a macro immediately if not protected by %nrstr(). Here we have
a simple macro giving values to macro variables "a" and "b" and we can
see the two lines in the data step following the "call execute" of the
macro "symget" these macro values and display them as set in the macro
just executed.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>15920</tt>
<br><tt>15921 %let a=;</tt>
<br><tt>15922 %let b=;</tt>
<br><tt>15923</tt>
<br><tt>15924 %macro test;</tt>
<br><tt>15925 %let a=AAAA;</tt>
<br><tt>15926 %let b=BBBB;</tt>
<br><tt>15927 %mend test;</tt>
<br><tt>15928</tt>
<br><tt>15929 %let a=;</tt>
<br><tt>15930 %let b=;</tt>
<br><tt>15931</tt>
<br><tt>15932 data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>15933 call execute('%test');</tt>
<br><tt>15934 a=symget('a');</tt>
<br><tt>15935 b=symget('b');</tt>
<br><tt>15936 put a= b=;</tt>
<br><tt>15937 run;</tt>
<br><tt>A=AAAA B=BBBB</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The lesson to be learned from this is that <b>macro calls in "call execute"
code need to be masked with %nrstr() in order for them to work correctly</b>
if you are expecting your macro to be called after the data step.
<p>There might be very rare cases where you do not want to use %nrstr()
because you need your macro to resolve within the data step (it might be
doing a macro read of a dataset and assigning needed macro variables, for
example) but these should be rare such that you never need to do it in
your whole programming career. Use %nrstr() for protecting macro calls
unless you know you have a clear need not to do so.
<h2>
The alternative to "call execute"</h2>
It is sometimes clearer and simpler to loop through a dataset using macros
and to call a macro within that loop. This is what I wrote the <a href="Spectre/utilmacros/getvalue.sas" target="_blank">%getvalue</a>
macro for many years ago. I use it in conjunction with my <a href="Spectre/utilmacros/nobs.sas" target="_blank">%nobs</a>
macro. This is how it is done:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%do i=1 %to %nobs(mydset);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let varn=%getvalue(mydset,nvalue,&amp;i);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let varc=%getvalue(mydset,cvalue,&amp;i);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %mymacro(&amp;varn,&amp;varc);</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have read about how you should use %nrstr() when calling a sas macro
in "call execute" code to ensure the macro is only called after the data
step and seen an alternative method that uses the %nobs and %getvalue macros.
