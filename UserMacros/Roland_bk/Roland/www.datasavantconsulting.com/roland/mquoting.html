<h1>
Macro Quoting Functions</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
When using the SAS macro language you are probably aware that if you use
unmatched quotes, unpaired brackets, commas and words such as "AND" then
this gives the SAS macro language parser difficulties. If you are referring
to these characters as text then these characters need to be masked, somehow,
so that the macro parser knows that you are treating these characters as
text. There are several so called "quoting functions" to do this and knowing
which one to use and when can be confusing. For many years I used "trial
and error" until I hit on the right combination because I did not have
time to study all the documentation on macro quoting which I thought would
take several hours. Indeed, if you try to learn from the online documentation
then not only will it take hours but you will be confused as well, because
the documentation is flawed.
<p>You will be pleased to know that all you need to learn about sas macro
quoting is explained on this one page and that it will take you less than
fifteen minutes to reach a full understanding. There will be no need for
trial and error in the future as you will instantly know what macro quoting
function to use. It is very easy once you have a grasp of the subject.
<p>The sas macro quoting functions discussed here are as follows: %str(),
%nrstr(), %quote(), %nrquote(), %bquote(), %nrbquote(), %superq() and %unquote().
<h2>
The Problem</h2>
First I will remind you of the problem of when the macro parser reads your
code and encounters these characters that you intended to be treated as
text.
<p>In the first example we run into a problem with an unmatched single
quote. The macro parser thinks you are quoting something as soon as its
hits the quote mark and regards everything as a string until it finds the
closing quote. It will assign everything following the equals sign to the
closing semicolon on the second line to the macro variable "str". Obviously,
that was not intended and you can see the result when it writes the content
to the log.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>1 %let str=Roland's place;</tt>
<br><tt>2 %let str2=, Biberach';</tt>
<br><tt>3 %put >>>> str=&amp;str;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>> str=Roland's place;%let str2=, Biberach'</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the second example we run into a problem of an unmatched round bracket:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>19 %let str=%trim(Rolands place( );</tt>
<br><tt>20</tt>
<br><tt>21 %put >>>> str=&amp;str;</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: Open code statement recursion detected.</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the third example we see a problem with the word AND:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>78 %macro test;</tt>
<br><tt>79 %let str=AND;</tt>
<br><tt>80 %if &amp;str EQ AND %then %put >>> str is AND;</tt>
<br><tt>81 %mend;</tt>
<br><tt>82</tt>
<br><tt>83 %test;</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: A character operand was found in the %EVAL function or %IF
condition where a numeric operand is required. The condition was: &amp;str
EQ AND</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: The macro TEST will stop executing.</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We need to mask these symbols or words that might cause us a problem.
This is what the macro quoting functions are for. But there are several
of these and it may not be obvious which one to use and when. All will
be made clear on this page.
<h2>
Macro variables populated from datasets</h2>
The biggest problem with macro quoting is where macro variables get populated
from datasets. This could be a "call symput" in a data step or a "select
into:" in SQL. A character variable in SAS can contain all sorts of characters
that will give the sas macro parser problems when its contents have been
written to a macro variable. In the following example you see an unmatched
single quote and a comma written to a macro variable that will give us
trouble in macro code once we try to resolve the contents of the macro
variable.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>call symput('mvar',"Roland's place, Biberach");</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Unless we can be completely sure that no such characters can find their
way into our macro variables then we need to use macro quoting functions
so that the macro parser treats the contents as text.
<h2>
%str() and %nrstr()</h2>
These two macro quoting functions, <b>%str() </b>and <b>%nrstr()</b>, are
used to quote fixed text. They have no effect on macros or macro variables
when they are resolved because they do their work before macro resolution
or macro variable resolution. They are known as "<b>compile time</b>" functions.
They might not be in a macro, though, they might be in open code, but the
fact is they finish their work before macro references get resolved which
is at "<b>execution time</b>". You do not need to worry about this fine
distinction. All you need to know is that you should use these macro quoting
function for fixed text - i.e. text that never changes.
<p>Remember this for %str() and %nrstr(). <b>They are for fixed text only</b>.
They do not work on resolved macro variable references because they are
unaware of them. If you try to use them, assuming they will work on the
contents of macro variables, you will get problems.
<p>Here is a simple example. We will write a string containing a comma
to a macro variable.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>call symput('mvar',"three, four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ");</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We will have no problem with the following because %str() will have
marked the two commas in the fixed text:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%put >>>>>> %sysfunc(trim(%str(one, two, )));</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But we will have a problem if we assume it is masking the content of
a macro variable. It can not do this as it is a "compile time" function
and can only work on fixed text. The comma in the resolved macro variable
is causing the problem, not the two commas after "one" and "two" because
it has masked these. It masked them and then its work was finished. Next,
the macro variable was resolved and it is this that caused the problem.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>139&nbsp; %put >>>>>> %sysfunc(trim(%str(one, two, &amp;mvar&nbsp;&nbsp;
)));</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: The function TRIM referenced by the %SYSFUNC or %QSYSFUNC
macro function has too many arguments.</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>></tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now we come to %nrstr(). The "nr" could be though of as "<b>no resolve</b>".
It masks macro variable references that start with "&amp;" and macro references
that start with "%" so that they do not resolve. Keeping out code for "mvar"
above then if we add a macro reference and compare the output then we can
see that %nrstr() has masked the "&amp;" and "%" so that it does not resolve.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>157</tt>
<br><tt>158&nbsp; %macro m; MMMMMMMM %mend m;</tt>
<br><tt>159</tt>
<br><tt>160</tt>
<br><tt>161&nbsp; %put >>>>>> %str(one, two, &amp;mvar %m&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> one, two, three, four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MMMMMMMM</tt>
<br><tt>162</tt>
<br><tt>163&nbsp; %put >>>>>> %nrstr(one, two, &amp;mvar %m&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> one, two, &amp;mvar %m</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>%str() is often used in macros to test whether a parameter value has
been supplied as a quoted string or not. But in testing whether the first
character is a quote mark then we have to "quote" it or we will run into
the problem of an unmatched quote so we would test it like this. Note that
we use %qsubstr() and not %substr() because if the value started with a
quote mark then %substr() would resolve to a literal quote which would
give us a syntax error. When you use %str() or %nrstr() to quote text that
has an unmatched quote or unmatched bracket or a percent sign then you
further have to mark these by placing a "%" in front of the character.
It's a strange oddity that you just have to remember to do.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%if %qsubstr(&amp;parm,1,1) EQ %str(%')</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;or %qsubstr(&amp;parm,1,1) EQ %str(%") %then %do;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To remind you about %str() and %nrstr() then these are used to mask
fixed text. %nrstr() is the "No Replace" version that masks "&amp;" and
"%" as well. And additionally, for unmatched quotes, unmatched brackets
and percent signs, you need to precede them with a "%".
<p>You'll be pleased to know that <b>the hard part is over</b>. The rest
is easy to understand and remember.
<p>Before leaving this section I will give a warning about the online sas
documentation where it seems to imply that %str() and %nrstr() can work
on resolved macro variable contents. They can not. They have finished their
work before the macro variable reference can be substituted so they can
not work on the macro variable contents.
<h2>
%quote() and %nrquote()</h2>
Now we come to the "<b>execution time</b>" functions. It is at execution
time that macro references and macro variable references get resolved so
you would use these "execution time" functions to macro quote resolved
macro variables and macros. This can be a mixture of fixed text and macro
references and macro variable references. %quote() and %nrquote() are early
versions of execution time macro quoting functions. <b>They are not very
useful.</b> They can not macro quote unmatched brackets and unmatched quotes.
They have been <b>superseded</b> by the "b" (for "blind") macro quoting
functions that you will learn about in the next section. They are obsolete
so you should never use them. They are only there so that legacy code can
use them. <b>You can forget about these two old quoting functions.</b>
<p>Before leaving this section then it is useful to explain that the "<b>nr</b>"
in the second function does not mean "no resolve" or "no replace". It stands
for "<b>no rescan</b>". These macro quoting functions are "execution time"
functions and so you would expect them to resolve macro variable references
and macro references, and indeed they do, but the "nr" macro function will
mask the "&amp;" and "%" <b>after</b> all references have been resolved
so that they are not "<b>rescanned</b>".
<h2>
%bquote() and %nrbquote()</h2>
The "b" in these execution time macro functions is short for "blind". They
are blind to what the contents inside the brackets might resolve to. They
will cope with unmatched brackets and unmatched quotes. You can think of
them as "version B" macros or "B for better" macros. The "nr" in the name
of the second macro function is for "no rescan", as explained in the previous
section.
<p>The "no rescan" of <b>%nrbquote()</b> is especially useful for limiting
warning messages written to the log so it is the better macro function
to use. But you have got to bear in mind that it masks the "&amp;" and
"%". If you are passing the results to the %eval() function and you want
the "&amp;" to be used as "AND" in that function then you must not use
%nrbquote(). You should use <b>%bquote()</b> instead. But for any other
use you should use %nrbquote() because this avoids clutter in the log when
there is a warning about macro variables or macros unable to resolve.
<p>In the following case they both act in the same way:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>166&nbsp; data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>167&nbsp; call symput('mvar',"three, four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ");</tt>
<br><tt>168&nbsp; run;</tt>
<br><tt>169</tt>
<br><tt>170&nbsp; %macro m; MMMMMMMM %mend m;</tt>
<br><tt>171</tt>
<br><tt>172</tt>
<br><tt>173&nbsp; %let x=%bquote(one, two, &amp;mvar %m&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>174&nbsp; %put >>>>>> &amp;x;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> one, two, three, four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MMMMMMMM</tt>
<br><tt>175</tt>
<br><tt>176&nbsp; %let x=%nrbquote(one, two, &amp;mvar %m&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>177&nbsp; %put >>>>>> &amp;x;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> one, two, three, four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MMMMMMMM</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But if we change the macro variable reference and the macro reference
so they can not be resolved and we see a difference in what is written
to the log.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>178&nbsp; %let x=%bquote(one, two, &amp;xx %x&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference XX not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference XX not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>179&nbsp; %put >>>>>> &amp;x;</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference XX not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> one, two, &amp;xx %x</tt>
<br><tt>180</tt>
<br><tt>181&nbsp; %let x=%nrbquote(one, two, &amp;xx %x&nbsp; );</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference XX not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>182&nbsp; %put >>>>>> &amp;x;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> one, two, &amp;xx %x</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can see from the above that %nrbquote() has quoted the "&amp;" and
"%" so that the macro parser does not try to resolve them a second time
for the "%put". With %bquote() a warning message is generated every time
this macro string is encountered because the "&amp;" and "%" are not masked
and so the macro parser tries to resolve them every time.
<p>In nearly all cases you will be better served by using <b>%nrbquote()</b>.
You will see it commonly used to enclose strings being passed to a macro
where the string might contain commas like in the following simple example:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%mymacro(%nrbquote(&amp;mystring));</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can use a mixture of fixed text and macro variable references. All
these execution time macros enable you to resolve macro variables inside
single quotes. You may have thought that it was not possible to resolve
macro variables inside single quotes but since these macro functions mask
the quotes then it will happily resolve.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%nrbquote('&amp;mystring')</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
%superq()</h2>
<b>%superq</b> is another execution time macro that takes as its argument
a <b>single macro variable name</b>. Note that it takes the <b>name</b>
of the macro variable. <b>You do not put a "&amp;" in front</b>. It only
works on <b>one</b> macro variable and is a fail-safe way of macro quoting
its contents. Unlike the other execution time macro quoting function that
allow for full and even nested resolution of macro variables and macro
calls, <b>%superq() allows for none at all</b>. You just get the characters
assigned to the macro variable with no substitution done because every
character that needs masking gets masked. In the following example you
see a comparison with the way %superq() behaves compared to %bquote() and
%nrbquote(). For the first macro variable all three mask in the same way
but for the second macro variable, %bquote() and %nrbquote() try to resolve
the macro variable contents, resulting in warnings. If you never want the
contents of a macro variable to be resolved then you should use %superq().
Despite its limitation of only working on one macro variable and nothing
else it is a very useful macro quoting function that you should use at
the appropriate time.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>70 options nonotes;</tt>
<br><tt>71</tt>
<br><tt>72 data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>73 call symput('mvar1',"Roland's place, Biberach");</tt>
<br><tt>74 call symput('mvar2',')"%x&amp;x');</tt>
<br><tt>75 run;</tt>
<br><tt>76</tt>
<br><tt>77</tt>
<br><tt>78</tt>
<br><tt>79 %put >>>>>> %superq(mvar1);</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> Roland's place, Biberach</tt>
<br><tt>80</tt>
<br><tt>81 %put >>>>>> %bquote(&amp;mvar1);</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> Roland's place, Biberach</tt>
<br><tt>82</tt>
<br><tt>83 %put >>>>>> %nrbquote(&amp;mvar1);</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> Roland's place, Biberach</tt>
<br><tt>84</tt>
<br><tt>85</tt>
<br><tt>86</tt>
<br><tt>87 %put >>>>>> %superq(mvar2);</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> )"%x&amp;x</tt>
<br><tt>88</tt>
<br><tt>89 %put >>>>>> %bquote(&amp;mvar2);</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> )"%x&amp;x</tt>
<br><tt>90</tt>
<br><tt>91 %put >>>>>> %nrbquote(&amp;mvar2);</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent invocation of macro X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference X not resolved.</tt>
<br><tt>>>>>>> )"%x&amp;x</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
%unquote()</h2>
If you stay within macro code then you do not need to use the <b>%unquote()
</b>function
but if you resolve a macro variable in such a way that you are creating
a piece of ordinary sas code, such as part of a data step or SQL, and you
want the contents of the macro variable to be treated as ordinary sas code
then you need to %unquote the final result otherwise you will get syntax
errors in a lot of situations. Just surround your macro expression with
the call to %unquote() like the following:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%unquote(macro expression &amp;a &amp;b etc.)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen that the compile time macro quoting functions, %str() and
%nrstr(), should be used for fixed text only and out of the four execution
time quoting functions then %nrbquote() should be the one you nearly always
use. Also that %superq() is a fail safe way to resolve a macro that is
supplied with a macro variable name (rather than a macro variable reference).
