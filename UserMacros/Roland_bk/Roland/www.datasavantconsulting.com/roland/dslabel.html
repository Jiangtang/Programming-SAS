Using the dataset label to automate reporting</h1></center>
<b>Last updated: 19 Aug 2014</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b>Wouldn't it be nice if we could somehow attach to a dataset all the
instructions needed for printing it?</b> This would have to somehow include
the <b>title</b>, the <b>footnotes</b> and, if not a standard "proc report"
of whatever variables happen to be there then a <b>list of variables and
their printing instructions</b> attached such as "<b>*o</b>" for "<b>order
order=internal</b>" and "<b>*on</b>" for "<b>order order=internal noprint</b>".
Well, we have <b>256 characters to play with</b> in the <b>dataset label</b>.
In most cases, we have enough space to store all three. We could have the
<b>title</b>
as the full text at the start of the dataset label (with maybe a split
character if there is more than one title), followed by a delimiter, followed
by a <b>list of footnote identifiers</b>, followed by another delimiter,
followed by a <b>list of variables with printing instructions</b> attached
(if a standard "proc report" will not give you what you want). I have used
this technique and it works very well and allows your reporting code to
be a lot simpler. Here is an example that I recently used in my work:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data &amp;source._det18_&amp;sampfile</tt>
<br><tt>(label="The following CPEVENT-PTM-PTNO combinations were not found
in sampling table &amp;sampfile:| FT05 |</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;actevent*on cpevent*o ptm*on ptmc ptno_list ");</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the example above you see the text I am going to use as the report
title, followed by the delimiter which is a "|", the footnote identifiers
(just FT05 in this case - but all reports will end with a common extra
final footnote), followed by another delimiter, and since a default "proc
report" will not give me what I need then the list of variables follows
with printing instructions attached to some variables as you can see from
the "*on", "*o" and "*on" attached to the "actevent", "cpevent" and "ptm"
variables (there will always be a variable named "holder" present so this
will be automatically added).
<p><b>And there you have the solution - it is so simple!&nbsp;</b> Just
put this needed information in the dataset label!
<p>In the following sections you will see how I handle this in some code
I am working on as I write this page.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Extracting the information from the dataset label</h2>
Imagine I have generated a number of datasets that I want to print. First,
I gather together a list of these datasets into the table "<b>listfiles</b>"
using the following code:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *--- get a list of all the details
listings ---;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create table listfiles
as&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select distinct memname
, memlabel</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from dictionary.tables&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where libname eq 'WORK'
and nobs gt 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and index(memname,"&amp;source._DET")
EQ 1;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quit;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can see from the code above that I am looking for datasets that
start with &amp;source (which is a macro variable I have set up) followed
by the characters "_DET" which indicate to me that it is a "details" dataset
I have created that I want to print, and I am only interested in those
datasets that have observations in them so I select those datasets using
"and nobs gt 0".
<p>Next, I loop through the datasets in "<b>listfiles</b>" and print them.
I extract the contents using my %getvalue macro (that you can download
from this web site). You can see that I am extracting the title of the
report that I call "listlabel", the footnote identifiers as "listfoots"
(if any are declared - otherwise this will be blank) and the variables
and their attached printing instructions as "listvars" (if any are declared
- otherwise this will be blank). Next I display these values in the log
for debugging purposes. Lastly, I print the datasets using an internally
defined macro named "%printit".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *--- loop through the detail listings
---;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %do l=1 %to %nobs(listfiles);</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let listfile=%getvalue(listfiles,memname,&amp;l);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let listlabel=%scan(%getvalue(listfiles,memlabel,&amp;l),1,|);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let listfoots=%scan(%getvalue(listfiles,memlabel,&amp;l),2,|);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let listvars =%scan(%getvalue(listfiles,memlabel,&amp;l),3,|);</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %PUT listfile=&amp;listfile;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %PUT listlabel=&amp;listlabel;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %PUT listfoots=&amp;listfoots;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %PUT listvars=&amp;listvars;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %printit;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %end;&nbsp; %*- list files -;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Please take time to look at the above code. Look at how easy it is to
print a variety of reports using "proc report". Each of these reports will
have its own title and footnotes and some will have specialized layout
requirements and yet it is all done using a call to the internally defined
macro "%printit". Look at how simple it is. Look at how it keeps your code
short and simple and easy to maintain. Gone are the messy "proc report"
steps for the different datasets that assign different footnotes and handle
different variable reporting needs. All replaced by a simple macro call
that uses information in the dataset label. Think on this and you might
see many uses for this technique that can greatly simplify your reporting
code.
<p>Next we will see the magic inside the %printit macro - except there
isn't any "magic" inside of it. It is very simple.
<h2>
%printit</h2>
In the %printit macro I am writing to an "ods document" destination that
could equally be an "ods pdf" destination (it will end up as a PDF anyhow
when I put it through a "proc document" step). This is not shown in the
macro. Because I am going to do some work with reorganising bookmarks I
am being careful what appears in the bookmark, so I am blanking out the
procedure label using ' <b>ods proclabel " "</b> ' and putting the title
of the report in the "contents" at the proc report level. I am using the
variable "<b>holder</b>", which I have as the value numeric "1" in every
reporting dataset, to set the lowest level content to null so it does not
show the text "Table" as the third level of the bookmark. This is a trick
that originated from the SAS Institute itself in a paper written by them.
You can read about this trick elsewhere on this web site.
<p>Note that generated titles. "&amp;filename" is defined elsewhere and
is basically what is in the macro variable "source" with ".txt" appended
as an ending. "&amp;listlabel" we already extracted, as shown above. So
you can see it has generated two titles. Maybe we could fit it into one
title is the character length of "&amp;listlabel" is not too long. That
is up to you. What you see below is not a recommendation - it is just how
I decided (for the moment) to implement it.
<p>Next the %dofoots macro is called to handle the footnote generation.
That will be described in the following section.
<p>In the "proc report" step there are two sections for handling the variable
list, if it is non blank. The first section uppercases it and then this
is followed by the "column" statement. The "<b>holder</b>" variable is
declared here as it is not supposed to be in the variable list. The "prxchange"
strips off the attached printing instructions for the variables leaving
only the variable list. It is doing a <b>non-greedy</b> match on a literal
asterisk that is followed by one or more non-space characters, followed
by one or more spaces, and replacing it with just a space which is what
you see as "/ /" at the end of the expression. The "?" that you see is
the <b>non-greedy</b> matching instruction. What this does is to tell prxchange
to find the shortest string that satisfies the match rather than the longest
string that it will give us by default. So this gives us "column holder
" followed by the list of variables without attached printing instructions.
It is now all in upper case.
<p>In the second section for handling the variable list (if it is non blank)
the "define" statements are created that default to "display" type but
can be set to "order order=internal" if an "*o" is attached to the variable
name and an "order order=internal noprint" if an "*on" is attached to the
variable name. It loops through the variable list until complete.

<br>&nbsp;</td>

</table>

<p>And there we have it. The %doofoots macro is explained next.
<h2>
%dofoots</h2>
The %dofoots macro loops through the &amp;listfoots value and generated
a footnote according to the footnote identifier it has found. These footnote
macro variables FT01, FT02 etc. are defined in the code. Right at the end,
it generates a final footnote "lastfoot" that is also defined in the code.
It will leave a gap of one footnote position if any footnotes have been
generated or use the footnote1 position if none have been generated.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<br><tt>%macro dofoots;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %local i foot;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let i=1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let foot=%scan(&amp;listfoots,&amp;i,%str( ));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %do %while(%length(&amp;foot));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; footnote&amp;i &amp;&amp;&amp;foot;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let i=%eval(&amp;i+1);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let foot=%scan(&amp;listfoots,&amp;i,%str(
));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %if &amp;i GT 1 %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; footnote%eval(&amp;i+1) &amp;lastfoot;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %else %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; footnote1 &amp;lastfoot;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>%mend dofoots;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Just to finish off, and this is not important - just a curiosity I thought
I would throw in, the last footnote "&amp;lastfoot" is defined as follows.
Since I am using "ods document" as my destination then I know that prior
to sas v9.4 then "left" and "right" alignment of footnote elements will
be lost. When the code runs under sas v9.4 or later I want to use those
alignment features but before then I will fake the "right" alignment as
best as I can using repeated spaces.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let lastfoot="^S={font_weight=medium color=blue}</tt>
<br><tt>ba_content_check_report.pdf, JobID: &amp;jobid, &amp;sysdate %sysfunc(repeat(%str(
),131))</tt>
<br><tt>page ^{thispage} / ^{lastpage}";</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; %if %sysevalf(&amp;sysver GT 9.3) %then&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let lastfoot=j=l "^S={font_weight=medium color=blue}</tt>
<br><tt>ba_content_check_report.pdf, JobID: &amp;jobid, &amp;sysdate"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; j=r "page ^{thispage} / ^{lastpage}";</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Further developments</h2>
I see these macros as something that should exist as inline code with different
modifications made to them depending on reporting needs. For example, I
might want to combine the two titles into one title if "&amp;listlabel"
resolves to less than 120 characters or whatever. It depends on what the
users want to see. Also, I have not coded for a split character in the
title text that indicates separate titles should be used. I have no need
for it at present but I will add it if needed. Also I might want to extend
the processing of the variable list to cover "across" variables as well.
Changes such as these I will make as and when the need arises. Consequently,
I hope that you will regard these macros as non-fixed and not a recommendation
that you should follow, so that you will feel free to make changes as you
see fit to support your reporting needs.
<h2>
Where else apart from the dataset label can I store print layout information?</h2>
Now you have read this page so far, can you think of another place to store
256 characters of print layout information .......?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
have dropped a big hint already......&nbsp;&nbsp; :o)
<p>Well, to answer that, you might have noticed that I have a variable
named "<b>holder</b>" that is present in every reporting dataset I create
and has the value "1" (numeric). I use this as per the published SAS Institute
trick, to prevent the third level of PDF bookmarks appearing and showing
the text "Table" (of course the variable could have a different name to
"holder" or could be a one byte character variable to save space, but I
use that name and make it numeric because of the published SAS paper).
I never display this "holder" variable nor use it for anything else apart
from suppressing the third level bookmark, so <b>I have the "holder" variable
label to use as I please</b> and that too is 256 characters in length.
So, if for some reason, I were unable to use the dataset label for the
purpose presented on this page, then I could put the same information in
the "holder" variable label and use my <b>%varlabel</b> macro (that you
can download from this web site) to extract the same information. Or maybe,
if I were sure that 256 characters would be enough for all my footnote
needs, I could put the text of the footnotes in the "holder" variable label
in full with a delimiter character for when it has to be split into different
footnotes. So you see we are not limited to just the 256 characters in
the dataset label. We have the "<b>holder</b>" variable label to use as
well.
<p>So now we have <b>two</b> places to store print layout information.
<b>Any
more?</b>
<p><b>Yes,</b> there are more places we could store print layout information.
Beyond using the "holder" variable label, we could set up dummy variables
and call them <b>ft1, ft2, ft3</b> etc. that are maybe only one character
in length and contain just a space for all datasets, and we could put separate
footnote lines in their variable labels and extract those using the <b>%varlabel</b>
macro. And what if we do not know if there be a ft1, ft2, ft3 variable?
Well, you can use my <b>%hasvars</b> macro (that you can download from
this web site) to check on whether a variable exists and to extract the
footnote information only if the variable exists. We could do the same
for titles and have one byte dummy variables called <b>tl1, tl2, tl3</b>
etc. and put the title information in there and define a list of variables
to print that exclude these and declare these to the "holder" variable
label. Or maybe not bother with a list of variables to print and have our
macro automatically exclude these variables from being printed. So the
possibilities are endless for automating our report production. We can
extend it as we need to. Using the ideas presented on this page, then for
"ods pdf" output where you are not interested in column widths and you
have chosen the correct labels for your columns so you don't need to specify
column labels in "proc report", then you should be able to wave goodbye
to tailored "proc report" code except for very special reporting needs.
<h2>
Where do we go from here?</h2>
If I were to create a new utility macro for handling this situation then
this is how I would do it. I would leave the dataset label untouched and
just leave it for useful descriptive text of what the dataset contains.
I would look for variables named<b> _title1, _title2, _title3</b> etc.
that I would assume were one byte character variables not containing anything
that needed displaying and use the variable labels as the titles. I would
look for variables named <b>_footnote1, _footnote2, _footnote3</b> etc.
used similarly and use the variable labels as the footnotes. I would look
for the "proc report" variable list with the attached printing instructions
in the label of a variable<b> _columns</b>. If this variable label were
blank then I would generate a list of variables using my <b>%varlist</b>
macro that starts with the "<b>holder</b>" variable hard-coded and lists
the rest of the variables in the order the variables occur in the dataset
(that
<b>%varlist</b> automatically gives me) but excluding the "<b>holder</b>"
variable and any "<b>_title(n)</b>" and any "<b>_footnote(n)</b>" and the
"<b>_columns</b>" variables from the list of variables.
<p>Although the direction I am indicating is opposite to the title of this
page, if you have followed the thinking so far, I think you will agree
that the logical developments suggest a new path for us to follow that
leaves behind the use of the dataset label.
<p><b>If we are using sas v9.4 </b>or higher versions then we have available
to us <b>extended attributes</b> for datasets that we can use. For <b>sas
v9.4</b> there is no point in putting the print layout information in variable
labels any more. We can assign them as extended dataset attributes and
give them non "<b>_</b>" prefixed names of "<b>title1</b>", "<b>title2</b>"
etc. , "<b>footnote1</b>", "<b>footnote2</b>" etc. and "<b>columns</b>".
<p>I have already written a version of the macro I am suggesting. It may
go through many changes. You can link to the current version here - <a href="Spectre/utilmacros/printit.sas" target="_blank">%printit</a>.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have been shown how to use the dataset label (plus other variable labels)
to automate your reporting. If&nbsp; you can see the possibilities that
the information on this page opens up for your organization's reporting
needs, then please share this page with your work colleagues.
