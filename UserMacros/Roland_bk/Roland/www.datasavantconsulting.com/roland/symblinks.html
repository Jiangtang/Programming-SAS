symbolic links</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 04 August 2003]</b>
<p>If you can store all your SAS macros in one library then all well and
good. But chances are you have a central macro library and next on the
search path is a project macro library. And because of your setup then
you can only point to the central library, your project library and no
other. It could be that your department has developed some macros that
are good for more than one project. You could make copies of these macros
but instead of making copies of macros it is better to create a <b>symbolic
link</b> from your project macro library to where the macro is stored.
This way, the macro appears to be in your library and acts like it is but
it isn't. By using symbolic links then only one copy of the macro needs
to exist. This is a good thing since any updates to it will be automatically
reflected in the other links. On the other hand, you had better make sure
that backups exist and that you are aware that any changes you make to
the code will affect other people in other project areas.
<p>The way you create a symbolic link is as follows. Make your project
directory the current directory then type in:
<p><b><tt>ln -s /full/path/name/of/source/aaa.sas aaa.sas</tt></b>
<p>..where the first entry after the -s option is the fully specified location
of the original macro plus its name. The last entry is just the plain macro
name which will be the same as the original macro except this time it is
the name of the entry you are putting in your local project directory.
<p>Note that you can edit the macro from any location so long as you have
the right permissions. But if you delete the symbolic link then it does
not delete the original macro. It just removes your link to it.
