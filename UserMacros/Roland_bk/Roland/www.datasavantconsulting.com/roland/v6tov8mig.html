<h1>
A v6 to v8 data migration</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>
<br><b>Updated: 25 Aug 2013</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This page will cover the thinking process required for a sas version 6
to version 8 data conversion/migration using a real case and will give
you snippets of code that you can adapt for your own use. Note that this
describes <b>data migration</b> only. If you are doing a full migration
then at the very least you will migrating <b>format catalogs</b> as well
(I would recommend the cntlout= and cntlin= method combined with fixing
invalid format names for this). Only <b>data migration</b> is covered on
this page.
<h2>
The scenario</h2>
The scenario is that a server and disk pool used for collecting and analysing
data from clinical trials is being decommissioned and the data needs to
be saved in an accessible form for the future. The data will be archived
but if there is a requirement to access it in the future then it must be
readable by more modern versions of sas. The versions of the sas data go
from sas 6.06, various higher version of sas 6 up&nbsp; to sas 8.2. Sas
9 and later can read sas 8 datasets but can not read sas 6 datasets so
the sas 6 data needs to be migrated to sas 8 before it can be archived.
Sas 6 datasets have a different file extension -- ".ssd01" rather than
".sas7bdat" for version 8. This gives us the possibility to migrate the
data and write it back to the same directory that the sas 6 data resides
in. This way the data "stays together" and this is an obvious requirement
as we can not convert the data from various studies and write the data
into a collective folder - there would be file name clashes and we would
not be able to tell what data belonged to what study. Also the code members
would likely no longer work so we have the opportunity to migrate to the
same folder which is the ideal scene. This is going to be the approach
described on this page.
<p>As for the server and its data then this is no longer in use by people
and the only user allowed access is the person doing the migration. As
such, the files are static in the disk pool and this person is not cpu
or work space restricted due to other users, although their configuration
might need to be changed so as to remove restrictions that might have been
put in place.
<p>It is assumed that you will be running the code interactively.
<h2>
What tool to use?</h2>
To "<b>data step</b>" or "<b>proc copy</b>" -- that is the question. For
sure, we can not rely on data steps for everything because sas 8.2 can
not read sas 6.06 datasets. We might consider a mix of data steps and proc
copy but if we use data steps then we also need to consider the dataset
labels. We would want to keep these and some extra coding will be required
for this for data steps. We might have a preference for data steps in the
case where there is an ALTER password assigned to the dataset to prevent
deletion but if we need to delete these datasets we can always use a system
delete, rather than a sas delete, as will be described later. Weighing
up the pros and cons then "<b>proc copy</b>" and only "proc copy" is the
only sensible choice. We are going to "proc copy" from a v6 source library
out to a v8 target library.
<h2>
Validation</h2>
Should we somehow validate the action of "proc copy" in migrating the data?
I think we should. The overhead is not great to use "proc compare" to do
this. Datasets can be compared "directly" with proc compare - there is
no need to sort and use "id" variables. You just do a direct "proc compare"
on the datasets as they are. You might think that this would generate a
lot of output that would be difficult to read through but this can be avoided
by running "proc compare" in "silent mode", looking at the contents of
the system macro variable SYSINFO at the end and if its value is not zero
then run a verbose "proc compare" to show details of the differences. "Proc
compare" is our way of proving that our data conversion worked correctly.
So after "proc copy"ing from a v6 source library out to a v8 target library,
we will do a direct "proc compare" between the dataset in its v6 form to
that dataset in its converted v8 form and show that they are the same and
write a confirmation to the sas log.
<h2>
Dry Runs</h2>
You will need to do many "dry runs" (aka "rehearsals") before you do the
migration for real and actually write the converted data into the folder.
You will hit many problems. For a "dry run" then you convert the datasets
to v8 and write them to the WORK library. Then the "proc compare" is between
the v6 datasets and the v8 dataset in the work library. Once done then
the dataset in the work library will be deleted. It is here that you will
be making use of "system deletes" since many of these datasets might have
an ALTER password assigned that will prevent a sas deletion.
<p>The aim of using "dry runs" is to identify and eliminate all obstacles
so that the "final run" will hopefully run from start to finish without
any problems.
<h2>
Libname statements</h2>
Since we are both reading from and writing to the same folder - reading
v6 and writing v8 - then how can we achieve both of these things using
libname statements? This is easy, as you will see below. We can explicitly
sas what data engine we want to use ("v6" and "v8"). At last, you will
see your firs bit of sas code (assume the directory path has been assigned
to the macro variable DIR):
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>libname v6data v6 "&amp;dir" access=readonly;</tt>
<br><tt>libname v8data v8 "&amp;dir";</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
What datasets do we process?</h2>
Assuming we have assigned our v6 data directory to the libref V6DATA then
how do we get the list of datasets we need to migrate? Maybe we want to
write this list to a macro variable. This is also easy - we can use the
<b>dictionary.tables</b>
table for this as follows. Some more code! :
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let memnames=;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select memname into :memnames separated by ' '</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; from dictionary.tables</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where libname="V6DATA" and memtype="DATA"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and memname not like '#TM%'</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and indexw("&amp;baddsets",memname)=0;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the code above, the list of datasets to process are written to the
macro variable memnames with the dataset names separated by spaces. Note
that we don't want to comvert any sas temporary datasets that might be
there that might be left over from a crashed session so we exclude the
memname if it starts with "#TM" (maybe that should be "_TM" - I will update
when I find out). Also, we might have a list of known bad datasets that
we can not convert written to a macro variable <b>baddsets</b> so we exclude
those as well.
<h2>
The "copy and compare" macro</h2>
Now we have written our list of datasets to process to the macro variable
<b>memnames</b>
then we need to pass this to some sas code for processing. It would be
normal to implement this as a macro so this is what you will see in the
code below. It will be well worth your time to study this code closely:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >

<h2>
Identifying the directories to process</h2>
Something that will take up the most time is identifying the directories
to process. There are various ways of doing this. On Unix, the<b> find</b>
command is used to find files that match a pattern. It will list these
files with the full directory path and you can use the <b>dirname</b> command
to give just the directory, without the file name, from this. This can
then be passed to <b>sort -u</b> to sort the directory paths so you are
left with unique values. All this can be used in a <b>pipe</b> filename
statement in sas. An example of this is below. To minimize use of the <b>find</b>
command then this is only run of the top directory has changed. I am setting
up an unfilled variable named "baddsets" for consistency when I merge with
other data that will have this variable set:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>*- Set to the top directory for looking for datasets to convert
-;</tt>
<p><tt>%let topdir=/saspeu/u01/sas6mig_write/d2/;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; %global holdtopdir;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- Run the FIND commands if there has been a change in the
value for the top directory -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *-&nbsp;&nbsp; (these can take a long time to run so they
are only done if strictly required)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; %if "&amp;holdtopdir" NE "&amp;topdir" %then %do;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let holdtopdir=&amp;topdir;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- pipe command for finding all directories containing
v8 datasets -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename v8dirs pipe "find &amp;topdir -name
'*.sas7bdat' | xargs -n1 dirname | sort -u";</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- read v8 directories into a dataset (will be
slow for higher directories) -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data __v8dirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; length dir $ 200 baddsets $ 100;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retain baddsets ' ';</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infile v8dirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; input dir;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- sort ready for a merge -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proc sort data=__v8dirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by dir;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- clear the v8 fileref -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename v8dirs CLEAR;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- pipe command for finding all directories containing
v6 datasets -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename v6dirs pipe "find &amp;topdir -name
'*.ssd01' | xargs -n1 dirname | sort -u";</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- read v6 directories into a dataset (will be
slow for higher directories) -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data __v6dirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; length dir $ 200 baddsets $ 100;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retain baddsets ' ';</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infile v6dirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; input dir;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- sort ready for a merge -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proc sort data=__v6dirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by dir;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *- clear the v6 fileref -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename v6dirs CLEAR;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The reason I am looking for directories with *.sas7bdat files in them
as well is in case they are the same as some directories containing *.ssd01
files. I will have to be careful in case there are already files of the
same name as both v6 and v8 datasets. I do a later merge that identifies
them. I also merge with some known "bad" directories to avoid processing
these.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp; *- Identify directories containing both types -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *- and select on the pure v6 data directories -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; data __bothdirs __v6good;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merge __v6dirs(in=_a) __v8dirs(in=_b) __baddirs(in=_c);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by dir;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if _a and _b then output __bothdirs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if _a and not _b and not _c then output
__v6good;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I do further manipulation to create a <b>__v6todo</b> dataset which
are the directories I want to process:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp; *- These are the v6 datasets to process -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; data __v6todo;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set __v6good</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %*- also use the directories that are both v6
and v8 -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %if &amp;useallv6dirs EQ Y %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __bothdirs</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __baddirs(where=(dir=:"&amp;topdir" and baddsets
ne ' '))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Before closing this section I would point out that the method used above
for getting a list of directories is not a recommendation. It depends on
the circumstances. For a static situation where data on disk can not change
then it may be better to run the <b>find </b>or whatever command on the
whole of the data only once and write this to datasets that you can use
in your code. Then you could select on these using "<tt>where=(dir=:"&amp;topdir")</tt>".
The initial build of these datasets might take a very long time but things
will run hugely faster after that if these datasets can be used.
<h2>
Looping through the directories dataset</h2>
There are different ways of looping through a dataset and doing processing
for each observation's values. The clearest and easiest way is to count
the number of observations and then in a macro loop to select one observation
at each iteration of the loop. You can do this using the <b>firstobs</b>
and <b>obs</b> dataset options. The <b>todostart</b> macro reference at
the start of the loop will be set to 1 but sometimes changed to a higher
number if you are restarting a dry run and do not want to repeat processing
for directories you know are good.

<h2>
Problems you might encounter</h2>
You will be doing many dry runs for each top level directory you choose
and you will encounter many problems with the data.
<h3>
sas v6.06 dataset warnings</h3>
Sas 6.06 datasets can not be read directly by sas v8. PROC COPY will not
complain if it encounters a 6.06 dataset as it is designed to cope with
it but when you do the "proc compare" then PROC COMPARE will complain about
it. There is no way you can suppress these warnings. They look like the
following:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>WARNING: File V6DATA.XXX.DATA is in an older/inefficient format.
Use the COPY procedure to migrate this data set to the more efficient Version
8 format. The COMPARE procedure can be used for verification.</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The text of the warnings also endorses our decision to use PROC COMPARE
after migration to validate the conversion.
<h3>
sas 6 dataset name longer than 8 characters</h3>
You will not be able to convert the sas v6 dataset if its file name is
longer than 8 characters. If you encounter these then what has happened
is that a user has made a backup of a sas dataset and added some qualifying
information to its name. You will still have to convert these. You might
come up with an automated method to do this or just use the dry runs to
identify these, note its directory and original name and then do a system
rename to shorten it to 8 characters or less, do the conversion, then name
it back again after the conversion.
<p>The message you will get in the log will look something like this if
you use the %copycomp macro above. The first two error message come from
the proc copy step. The next two come from the proc compare step. The last
is a user error message coming from the end of the %copycomp macro.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ERROR: The file V6DATA.XXXX_SAVE.DATA has too long a member name
for the V6DATA library.</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: File WORK.XXXX_SAVE.DATA has not been saved because copy
could not be completed.</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: The file V6DATA.XXXX_SAVE.DATA has too long a member name
for the V6DATA library.</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: File WORK.XXXX_SAVE.DATA does not exist.</tt>
<br><tt>ERROR: "Proc compare" differences were found with XXXX_SAVE</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
Bus errors</h3>
Bus errors are nasty. If you get these it can either mean that your v6
dataset is corrupted or that you have run out of WORK space. Some of the
datasets you are creating might be huge but they still have to be able
for fit in the WORK library when you are doing dry runs. And you can't
avoid doing dry runs - these are your route to a successful data conversion.
Your sas session might have been configured to give you only a limited
WORK space so at some stage you will have to ask the systems administrator
to increase your allowance.
<p>You will notice, if you look, that the %copycomp macro copies and convert
on dataset at a time and deletes it at the end. This is to save space in
the WORK library but this may not be enough for your needs.
<p>Bus errors will crash your conversion code and leave a lock on the V6DATA
libref or whatever named libref you are using as the source directory but
you will be able to continue with other sas work. To rerun the conversion
code, you will have to close the session and restart it. You will maybe
want to assign the directory that gave the bus error to a different libref
and do some diagnostic testing to find out what is wrong before closing
the session and restarting.

<h3>
I/O errors reading past the end of dataset</h3>
If you see error messages concerned with reading past the end of the dataset
and it turns out that the source dataset has zero observations then you
can ignore these as there is no data there to migrate.
<h3>
Others</h3>
There may be other problems. Deal with these as you encounter them.
<h2>
The Final Run</h2>
When all your dry runs are over then you do the final run. This should
go through to completion but you may run into space limitation issues.
Good luck!
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have been given a comprehensive description of issues relating to a
sas v6 to v8 migration.
