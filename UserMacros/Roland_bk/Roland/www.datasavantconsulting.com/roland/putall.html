put (_all_) (=)</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 08 September 2007]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
You will certainly be familiar with the "put" statement that you use in
data steps. You have probably used the "put _all_=;" statement to put out
a list of all your dataset variable names with their values but what about
"put (_all_) (=);"? If you have easy access to sas then try out "put _all_=;"
and compare it with what you get with "put (_all_) (=);". If you do this
then you will probably notice that there is no _ERROR_= and _N_= in the
list of variables in the second case. Why should that be?
<h2>
put (_all_) (=) explained</h2>
"put" can work with lists of variables and lists of formats. The list of
variables goes in round brackets followed by the list of formats, again
in round brackets. So what the "(_all_)" gives you is a list of all the
variables in the dataset (not including the automatic variables) and the
"(=)" sign says to use the equals sign after each variable in the list.
The result is the same as what you get with "put _all_=" but without the
automatic variables.
<h2>
Put Statement, Formatted</h2>
There are many forms of the humble "put statement". Using a "put" statement
in the form "put (_all_) (=)" falls under the title "Put Statement, Formatted"
that you can read about in the sas documentation. I'll let you look that
up for more details but once you know about this you will find yourself
using this technique for putting values to the log in a more convenient
form, especially when you are debugging code.
