Modular Macro Design</h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
If our aim is to build up a collection of macros for use in clinical reporting
then we need to start with a higher level view of what we want to achieve
and how we are going to achieve it. For the higher level view we turn to
the idea of “Modular Programming” as this can provide us with benefits.
The Spectre macro collection will provide real-world examples throughout,
although this is not intended as a recommendation.
<h3>
Spectre Macros</h3>
Spectre Macros (originally “Roland’s SAS Macros”) are an example of a collection
of macros using modular programming design. From the Wikipedia article
on Modular Programming we have this as a description “Modular programming
is a software design technique that increases the extent to which software
is composed from separate parts, called modules. Conceptually, modules
represent a separation of concerns, and improve maintainability by enforcing
logical boundaries between components”. Spectre macros started out as a
collection of utility macros that was extended over many years until it
covered every low level task that might be encountered in Clinical Reporting
and ended up as a complete Clinical Reporting system. There are many low-level
tasks that are common to all clinical reporting functions, such as counting
the number of observations in a dataset, returning the format of a variable,
etc.. Nearly every clinical reporting function will possess these as tools,
usually in the form of macros. This results in a lot of duplication in
the industry. Spectre macros aimed to collect the full set of these utilities
and make them freely available to everyone in the industry as public domain
software so that it was free of Copyright considerations. The Spectre macro
collection can be linked to at the following web site.

<h3>
“Separation of Concerns”</h3>
If you look at the Wikipedia description of “Modular Programming” you see
the phrase “separation of concerns”. This phrase can easily be glossed
over but it is worth stopping and thinking about this as this is the key
to writing a truly useful collection of macros. If you can “separate the
concerns” into different macros then you will have components from which
it is possible to create larger structures made of these components. Spectre
turned into a complete Clinical Reporting System that naturally grew out
of its component macros. The component macros become like a meta language
from which it becomes easier to build more complex structures. The key
to success is to truly separate out the functions of the macros. This is
more easily said than done and requires a great deal of thought. There
are approaches you can take to help you achieve this. One is to limit the
scope of each macro and name it according to its task so that it does this
function (well) and does no more. For example, a macro that counts the
number of observations in a dataset might be called “nobs” (“Number of
observations”) that returns the number of observations in a dataset but
can do no more than this. This way, you know that if you have a macro called
“nobs” then you can rely on it to give you the number of observations in
a dataset without having any concerns about whatever other functionality
it may have. It is easy to lose this idea of “separation of concerns” as
your macros become more complex. For example, most clinical reporting macros
you will encounter in the industry are concerned to some extent with titles
and footnotes. You will see reporting macros with parameters named title1=,
title2, foot1=, foot2= etc.. The “concerns” have then become mixed since
creating output should be a separate concern to positioning titles and
footnotes. It is far better if you can avoid this. The Spectre clinical
reporting macros, for example, do no titles and footnotes handling. There
are other macros for this. The Spectre reporting macros are also entirely
independent from other aspects of the reporting system such as the handling
of titles and footnotes and the running of reports. This is done to such
an extent that the reporting macros can be removed entirely from the reporting
system known as Spectre and will work independently and will not even know
if the Spectre system is working in the same environment.
<p>The Spectre reporting macros have further “separation of concerns”.
The p-values these macros calculate are done in co-macros so that if problems
are found then these macros can be worked on independently. The mapping
of statistic labels such as mapping “Std.” to STD are done in a separate
macro so that the user can change this to add labels and change the mapping
without this affecting the main reporting macro. Wherever a separate “concern”
is identified then there will be a separate macro to do this.
<h3>
Reliability of the Components</h3>
The more low-level the macro, the more you need to be able to rely on it.
A complex reporting macro will have bugs in it. The more complex it is,
the more bugs it will have. Even after many years of use there will be
bugs discovered. However, the lower the level of macro, the less visible
it is and the more insidious will be the consequences of any bug so these
low level macros have to be more reliable. If these macros are simple enough
then it should be possible to eliminate all bugs. You should avoid any
potential problem from these macros. A good example of such a macro is
the “words” macro used in Spectre. This counts the number of space-delimited
strings (or “words”) in a macro string. This macro was updated at some
time to use the countw() function but it was found that in rare circumstances
it could return a zero value in a form such as 1.4567E-147 which although
equal to zero from a numeric accuracy point of view, is not equal to the
actual “0” expected. As a result, this macro had to be changed back to
its original form where it did not use the countw() function even though
efficiency was lost as a result. Reliability is more important than efficiency
for these low level components.
<p>You would normally take more care writing a macro that is a component
of a modular system. A great deal of thought has to be put into defining
its purpose and the way it will work with the other macros and because,
once written, it will become the “standard” component for performing this
function then its documentation has to be of a high standard so that programmers
know how to call it and use it. For the smaller macros in Spectre, the
ratio of time and documentation compared to actual coding time is about
5:1 and a typical small macro that might only contain fifty lines of code
will take about twelve hours of work before it can be released.
<h3>
Modular macros in action</h3>
The best way to see modular macro design in action is to study an example.
Below is a link to the %unistats macro in Spectre.

<h2>
Macro Collection Standards</h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
Once we have worked out our higher level approach then it is time to think
about the standards we will impose on our collection of macros as a whole
which goes beyond just accumulating individual macros.
<h3>
Naming Convention</h3>
There are different approaches to naming the individual macros in your
collection. Some might start them all with a “u” to signify that they are
“User” macros. You might start them with an “x” to indicate they are system
macros. If you had two libraries of macros, one for system macros and one
for user macros, then this naming convention would make a lot of sense.
It depends on circumstances. The Spectre macros have no naming conventions
applied beyond that given in the first section on “Modular Macro Design”
in that the name says what the macro does. The Spectre macros were intended
to all go in one library and become a user library of sasautos and since
the macros in the SAS supplied sasautos have no particular naming convention
then no naming convention is applied to the Spectre macros. The downside
to this is that you have got to hope that some of these macros do not get
overwritten by work macros of the same name during the normal course of
programming.
<h3>
Macro Headers</h3>
All the macros should have the same style header. This might be a different
header to normal program code headers since different categories might
apply. What you put in the header is up to you but bear in mind whether
people will correctly fill in these headers and keep them up to date when
changes are made.&nbsp; If you make the header too complicated then the
header information will not be properly maintained and the macro could
become less useful as a result or the macro description could become misleading,
which is worse. Most macro headers use a rightmost character such as an
asterisk. It gives a better box shape to the header. But if people maintaining
these macros lengthen strings in the header and do not reset the position
of this rightmost character, or use a text editor when tabs are used, then
the header will go out of shape after a time. Spectre macros do not use
a rightmost character in the header because of this problem. Macros should
have an amendment history section. You have got to think how many times
the most amended macro will be updated and design your amendment section
accordingly. If, for example, you think one of the macros might be amended
fifty times then it would be better if the amendment history section allowed
single line updates. You will see that the Spectre macros allow for single
line updates if you follow the link above. There are no hard and fast rules
for header design other than having a header that will be simple enough
so that its information will be kept up to date and will maintain its usefulness
even after many changes.
<h3>
Code Indentation</h3>
It is better if the indentation of code is the same across the collection
of macros but so long as it is consistent within a single macro then this
should not be a big problem. Bear in mind that the SAS editor may be using
tabs for indentation and the code might be worked on by another person
using a text editor that does not show the indentation due to tabs so the
alignment can go out of shape. It is better to deactivate the tabs in the
SAS editor. It is normal practice to indent macro declarations. Certainly,
you should do this if you define macros within your macro. But as for the
macro as a whole then the benefit of this is doubtful as it would mean
wasting two or three spaces on every line without adding to the clarity
of the code. Most Spectre macros do not indent the whole macro but indent
macros defined within them.
<h3>
Code Style</h3>
Code style can cover things like capitalizing SAS keywords and the “tightness”
of the code in that there will be spaces left before and after equals signs
or not to aid readability. Tight code might be better if your macros contain
long lines of code but only if it helps the code to be more readable by
keeping code on one line rather than splitting it into two. As for the
length of the lines of code then it is better if you do not have to scroll
across the page to see the end of the line. For whatever editor you use,
make sure the lines do not cause a scroll bar to appear. To do this you
might have to limit the line length to eighty or ninety characters. Sometimes
you will break this rule but it should not become a habit. The only exception
to this allowed in the macro header should be for when you are including
example output from the macro as part of the macro description. If the
header alone causes a scroll bar to appear it will give the impression
that some of your lines of code might be longer than page width when in
fact this might not be the case.
<h3>
Macro Parameter Naming Conventions</h3>
You will need a consistent naming convention for your parameters. The parameter
name for the input dataset, for example, should be the same for all macros
having an input dataset. The name you choose should be descriptive enough
without being too long or too short. Using the input dataset as an example
then “d=” is not descriptive enough - “dsin=” would be better. You will
often have both input and output datasets so “dsin=” and “dsout=” are good
names for these.
<h3>
Keyword or Positional parameters</h3>
Macro parameters can either be positional or keyword parameters. Positional
parameters are defined first for a macro followed by the keyword parameters,
if there are any. For positional parameters you need not supply the name
of the macro parameter, you just have to supply the value. But you need
to know what value goes where. If you have a lot of positional parameters
then it is possible for people to forget the order and so your macro might
crash or might give the wrong results so, as a general rule, only macros
with a small number of parameters should be allowed to use positional parameters.
Some people think they have to standardize on this across their macro collection
but if you have a macro that returns the observation count of a dataset
then “%nobs(dataset)” is easier to use than “%nobs(dsin=dataset)” for example.
Many of the Spectre macros allow for positional parameters for ease of
use.
<h3>
Function-Style Macros</h3>
If you can write a utility macro that avoids using data step or procedure
boundaries then you have the possibility of creating what is called a “function-style
macro”. These function-style macros “return” a value and act like a macro
function does in SAS macro code. You can open, read and close SAS datasets
using pure macro code rather than using a data step and this should be
the method you use if you can. The Spectre “nobs” dataset, for returning
the number of observations in a dataset, works in this way. You can link
to it below. If your macro is a function-style macros then you should clearly
state this in the header of the macro. Also, in this case, a “usage” section,
to show how the macro is called would be of help. And, of course, to keep
the header consistent for all macros then a “usage” section will be needed
in every macro header.
<p><a href="Spectre/utilmacros/nobs.sas" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/utilmacros/nobs.sas</a>
<p>More care is required when writing function-style macros than when writing
macros of the ordinary type. For example, most people assume that when
a macro is called then the macro call has to end with a semicolon. This
has never been the case and will cause a function-style macro to issue
strange syntax errors that are hard to debug. You should avoid using “%put”s
in function-style macros except perhaps for putting out error messages
if the macro fails. Comments in function-style macros should be “macro”
comments (starting with “%*”) rather than sas code comments (starting with
“*”) or else syntax errors will result. Another trap is when you return
the result macro-quoted. In your SAS supplied macro library you will notice
that there are some macros that start with a “Q” and there are also inbuilt
macro functions that start with a “Q”. This is to tell you that a macro-quoted
value is returned. Macro-quoted values can cause syntax errors if the value
the macro returns is used in ordinary SAS code. You have to use the “%unquote()”
function to nullify macro-quoting if you want to use the result in SAS
code. If you return a macro-quoted result then this should be made very
clear in your macro description. Preferably, you should start the name
of any macro that returns a result macro-quoted with a “Q”. An example
of a macro that returns a result macro-quoted can be linked to below.

<h3>
Parameter Descriptions</h3>
The list of parameters and their descriptions should be clearly stated
in the macro header in its own section. If the parameter has a default
value, either coded into the macro call or set up inside the macro then
this should be shown. Positional parameters should be clearly indicated.
The Spectre macros use the indicator “(pos)” for positional parameters
and omit this for keyword parameters. It should be made clear whether the
value you supply to the parameter should be quoted or unquoted.
<h3>
Parameter Value Checking</h3>
We should check parameter values to some extent. The minimum checking done
should at least ensure that the macro can run, given the parameters values
provided. More comprehensive checking could check whether parameter values
are as expected such as whether they are numeric or character (the SAS
supplied %datatyp macro can be useful for this) or, for variable names,
whether these variables exist in the dataset. There is a great deal of
checking that could be done but the more checking you do, the longer it
will take to code the checking and more will be added to the processing
overhead of the macro. If your macro users are not experienced programmers
then you will tend to do more parameter value checking to “catch” the problems
before the macro starts processing proper. This will allow you to put out
more meaningful error messages then the user will be able to understand
from the SAS log. Also, in trapping these errors, trap as many errors as
you can at one time. If the first parameter value is wrong, for example,
then do not just put out an error message for this first parameter and
end the macro – check all the parameters you can, report on them all, and
then end the macro. This way the user can hopefully call the macro correctly
at the next attempt. The Spectre macros are aimed to be used by experienced
programmers and are aimed to run on low powered servers so the parameter
checking done is at a minimum. However, as many parameters as possible
will be checked to help the programmer call the macro correctly at their
next attempt.
<h3>
Macro Version Numbers</h3>
It is helpful to both have a macro version number in the macro header and
to write this same version number to the log. You only need to write the
version number once to the log so the best place for this is before the
macro definition so that when the macro gets compiled, the version number
will be written to the log at compile time but will not be written for
subsequent calls. The Spectre macros do this for all macros. The release
version of the Spectre macros is always shown as version 1.0 with a blank
amendment history, even if the macro went through many iterations before
it was released. It is the release of the macro that starts the version
number counting system. Small changes to the macro that affect functionality
are reflected in incrementing the count after the decimal point. It is
not a decimal fraction. If the macro undergoes a major revision then the
count to the left of the decimal point is incremented and the value to
the right of the decimal point is reset to “0”. For example, a version
number of 6.17 means that the macro underwent 5 major revisions and 17
minor revisions since the last major revision. If the header of a Spectre
macro is updated but the code is not changed then the version number stays
the same except that the date shown in the header will change. Version
numbers are purely to do with functionality.
<h2>
Individual Macro Standards</h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
After we have decided on our high-level approach and our standards for
the macro collection as a whole we have to decide upon standards for the
individual macros or indeed, what we allow to become a macro.
<h3>
The “added value” approach</h3>
A macro should add value otherwise there is no point in having a macro.
That value could come in the form of making coding easier or in help imposing
a standard that adds consistency across the programming function. A programmer
has to learn about the macro if they are supposed to use it and this takes
time. We should not slow the programmer down if they could do with ease
what the macro is doing by using straight SAS code. Take the task of sorting
datasets, for example. It would be pointless to write a macro that sorts
datasets since this is easily done by using “proc sort” in normal SAS code.
Such a macro would not add value. Macros should be written because they
“need” to be written – not just for the sake of it.
<h3>
Coding Standards</h3>
Most of the coding standards for these macros will be covered by existing
coding standards except the macro header might differ from the usual program
header. Extra specific macro coding standards will be to store and restore
system options at the star of a macro and restore them at the end of the
macro for when macros change these options. It is very important to declare
all your local macro variables. If you do not do this for your incremental
variables (e.g. “i” as used in “%do i=1 %to 10;”) then this could affect
variables in the calling macros and cause strange results and incomprehensible
errors. Declaring your local macro variables should be done somewhere near
the top of your macro code. If your macro creates temporary datasets that
are not needed after the macro ends then you should delete these datasets
somewhere in your macro. You should be careful that the names you choose
for your temporary datasets do not conflict with the dataset names of the
macro user. You might like to start the temporary dataset name with an
underscore and somehow link the name to the macro name. For example, the
temporary datasets used by the %unistats macro that you can link to above
usually start with “_uni”. If you create temporary variables then again,
ensure there is no naming conflict with any existing variables. You could
use the convention of naming temporary variables starting with an underscore
and make it a rule that programmers using your macro should not themselves
have variables in their datasets whose name starts with an underscore.
