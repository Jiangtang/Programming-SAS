Floating-point Number Accuracy</h1></center>

<h2>
The VAX to Unix puzzle</h2>
You transfer SAS data from a VAX to a Unix platform. You know full well
you have visits with a numeric session number of 2.1. You are looking at
the data and you select on the data with "where sess=2.1". Nothing there.
You cancel the where clause, look at your data again and you see observations
with sess=2.1. What on Earth is going on?
<p>The answer lies in the way numeric values are stored on a computer.
In the case of floating point numbers, the values are rarely stored exactly.
They are a very close approximation instead. And the problem is that on
different platforms you get different approximations. If you had done the
same "where sess=2.1" on the VAX then you would have seen the observations
you know are there. But after it has moved to Unix then they are changed
very slightly and the equality no longer holds. On the VAX, the literal
"2.1" gets converted into its numeric form and it matches with the "2.1"
held in the "sess" variable. Again, they are not exactly 2.1. They are
approximations. But they are the <b>same</b> approximations in this case.
But when the data gets transferred over onto Unix, the 2.1 in the sess
variable turns into something slightly different than the literal "2.1"
does when converted to numeric form.
<p>This is just the start of your problems. If you test equalities, even
just on the one platform, then you can get surprised by these inaccuracies.
This will be taken up in the next section. But staying with the VAX to
Unix transfer of data - what is the best way to handle this situation?
<p>Suggested solutions will vary. I personally consider the numeric inaccuracy
you get when SAS data moves platforms as a SAS problem. If the equality
works on the VAX then it should work on Unix, in my opinion. Yes, the numbers
will not be exact - but they should be inexact by the same amount. If SAS
data is transferable from one platform to another, then to me, it should
behave the same on each platform. The way I got round this problem was
to round every single numeric field in every dataset to the tenth decimal
place. Now this is naughty in one sense since if you had a representation
of pi (sorry, no symbol) then you would have introduced an inaccuracy by
rounding to the tenth decimal place. But since the data was Clinical data
and since each number represented a field that the investigator had to
fill in that had limited decimal places then rounding to the tenth place
could not possibly adversely affect the accuracy of the values. So I did
this and it worked fine. It was very easy to do as well since I wrote a
macro to do this which you can see a version of <a href="round.sas">here</a>.
<h2>
The problem with equalities</h2>
if you are able, then copy this piece of code and run it under SAS:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=7.3;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=x+0.1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; put x=;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if x EQ 7.4 then put "equals 7.4";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; else put "not equal to 7.4";</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What you will find if you do, is that "x" displays as 7.4, but when
the equality is tested, it will be found that the equality is not met.
Try another number like start with 7.2, add 0.1, and test the equality
with 7.3 and the equality will be met. So if we arrive at a number through
a mathematical process then we should not expect equalities to hold on
every occasion. This is an irritation more than anything else. You could
always round the result to the tenth decimal place (like I did to data
transferred from VAX to Unix) and then you would never have a problem doing
the above sort of test. Take a look at the log of the same code I have
made some additions to:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>73 data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>74 y=7.4;</tt>
<br><tt>75 put y= y=hex16.;</tt>
<br><tt>76 x=7.3;</tt>
<br><tt>77 x=x+0.1;</tt>
<br><tt>78 put x= x=hex16.;</tt>
<br><tt>79 if x EQ 7.4 then put "equals 7.4";</tt>
<br><tt>80 else put "not equal to 7.4";</tt>
<br><tt>81 x=round(x,0.0000000001);</tt>
<br><tt>82 put x= x=hex16.;</tt>
<br><tt>83 if x EQ 7.4 then put "equals 7.4";</tt>
<br><tt>84 else put "not equal to 7.4";</tt>
<br><tt>85 run;</tt>
<p><tt>y=7.4 y=401D99999999999A</tt>
<br><tt>x=7.4 x=401D999999999999</tt>
<br><tt>not equal to 7.4</tt>
<br><tt>x=7.4 x=401D99999999999A</tt>
<br><tt>equals 7.4</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you study the above you will see that the 7.4 in the "y" variable,
when displayed also in hex, is different to the 7.4 in the "x" variable
after 0.1 is added to 7.3. The "A" at the end equates to binary "1010"
whereas the "9" at the end equates to binary "1001". When you test for
an equality, the computer is doing a direct comparison of these effective
binary digits and the equality will be found not to hold. But if you look
later on in the code you will see that I have rounded the value in "x"
to the tenth decimal place and the equality will now hold since the value
in "x" gets "corrected" by this rounding.
<p>So how do we get round this problem? Well, you could either round to
the tenth decimal place and then do the test or you could test for equality
and apply whatever rounding you desired like this "if round(x,0.1) EQ 7.4".
But both these methods have limitations. In the case of rounding to the
tenth decimal place then that will be no good for extremely large numbers
and in the case of rounding to one decimal place then if x=7.37 then it
will equate with 7.4 using the above test. Do we really want that? I wouldn't
have thought so. So we have come up with two solutions and both of them
have problems. Perhaps it is time to look at numbers at the other extreme
to see if we can generate a few new ideas.
<h2>
Big numbers have problems as well</h2>
Take a look at the following log of code I have run:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>102 data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>103 x=123456789012345678;</tt>
<br><tt>104 put x=18.;</tt>
<br><tt>105 x=123456789012345678901;</tt>
<br><tt>106 put x=21.;</tt>
<br><tt>107 run;</tt>
<p><tt>x=123456789012345680</tt>
<br><tt>x=123456789012345683968</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You will see that the first "x" is out by 2 since it ends with "80"
instead of the original "78". The second "x" is out by 5067 since it ends
with "83968" instead of the original "78901". There is no point trying
to get round this by rounding to the tenth decimal place since these are
whole numbers in any case and large ones at that.
<p>If you were to express the numbers as exponentials then you will see
that the problem seems to creep in after the 15th decimal place. But if
two numbers match to 15 decimal places then maybe we should consider them
as equal, to all intents and purposes. Is there maybe another way we could
test for equality that took this into account such that we could use it
on small numbers like 7.4 and large numbers like the above?
<h2>
The %equals macro</h2>
There is a way to compare numbers for equality that will work for both
small and large numbers. I have incorporated code I found on the SAS Technical
Support site (in their macro <a href="http://www.sas.com/service/techsup/unotes/SN/003/003510.html">%fuzzcomp</a>)
into the macro %equals, after making a change. It maybe needs a bit more
"tuning".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>174 data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>175 x=7.3;</tt>
<br><tt>176 x=x+0.1;</tt>
<br><tt>177 if %equals(x,7.4) then put "equals";</tt>
<br><tt>178 else put "not equal";</tt>
<br><tt>179 x=123456789012345678;</tt>
<br><tt>180 if %equals(x,123456789012345678) then put "equals";</tt>
<br><tt>181 else put "not equal";</tt>
<br><tt>182 x=123456789012345678901;</tt>
<br><tt>183 if %equals(x,123456789012345678901) then put "equals";</tt>
<br><tt>184 else put "not equal";</tt>
<br><tt>185 run;</tt>
<p><tt>equals</tt>
<br><tt>equals</tt>
<br><tt>equals</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I invite people to play around with the values in the macro. To "tune"
it, in a sense. I am fairly happy with the way it works currently but I
am sure it could be improved. The idea is to use the macro universally
to test for equality (or very near equality). Perhaps it could be adopted
as the "standard" for testing equality. You can view the macro
<a href="equals.sas">here</a>.
