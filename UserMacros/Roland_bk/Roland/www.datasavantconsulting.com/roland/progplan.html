<h1>
Using a "programming plan" for clinical reporting</h1></center>

<p><br>This page is not about a SAS tip. It is about organizing the sas
work for producing tables and listings for clinical trials. Some pharmaceutical
companies create a "<b>programming plan</b>" before any work on sas programming
commences and this plan has to be "signed off" as part of their SOPs. I
think it is a very good idea and having followed SOPs that do not require
this and those that do, I have seen the advantages in requiring this extra
step. What it does is very simple, for each program that must be written,
it contains a minimal description about what special technique should be
used (if any) for a program and how the data should be selected for each
table and listing. Both the programmer and QC programmer are required to
follow this plan. The entry for each program might be as simple as "FASCD=1"
or "Window data as per page 8 of protocol. ITTPOP=1".
<p>Here are a list of reasons why I think doing this is a good idea and
should be part of the SOPs.
<ul>
<li>
This is planning before taking action, which is always a good idea. The
planning can be completed before data comes in when the programmers are
under no pressure to produce output, so this gives the planning a chance
to be accurate and thorough.</li>

<li>
When programmers are under pressure to produce output, they have less time
to spend checking through the protocol for important information on how
to select data. Sometimes they will try but give up due to lack of time
and just make an educated guess. This can give rise to errors.</li>

<li>
If outputs are checked by a QC programmer by double-programming, most of
the time spent by the QC programmer resolving differences will be due to
a different method being used to select data. If there is a document that
states this clearly for each table and listing that has been agreed upon,
then this problem will not occur and the QC work runs faster for both the
QC programmer and the tables and listings programmer who gets less interruptions
to resolve these differences.</li>

<li>
If the "programming plan" is signed off by the study statistician then
they might spot problems that the programmers are blind to and have gotten
wrong. This will avoid some errors and hopefully give the statistician
more confidence in the outputs being produced.</li>

<li>
Protocol changes happen from time to time and if the programmers have already
started programming it might not be clear to them how this will affect
output. But if the protocol change is followed by an update of the "programming
plan" and it is made clear what the new changes are then both the programmer
and QC programmer willl be able to update their code easily and correctly.</li>

<li>
Tables to listings cross-checking can take a long time and programmers
will be doing this when they are tired from completing the programming
tasks and will be more prone to error. Differences will mainly be due to
differing data selection so if this is made clear in the "programming plan"
then cross-check errors should rarely occur.</li>
</ul>
