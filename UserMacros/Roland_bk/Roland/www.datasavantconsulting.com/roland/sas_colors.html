Choosing colors for your html output</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
If you used SAS "<b><i>in the old days</i></b>" like I did, the colors
you were limited to tended to be linked to the printers, or to be more
precise, the "<b>plotters</b>". These plotters had physical colored pens
in them and the plotter would pick out one of these pens and physically
draw with it before replacing the pen and picking out another pen. It used
to be quite entertaining for me to watch one of these plotters at work.
The color you chose had to be a color in one of those pens. You could not
mix colors. Hence you were limited to colors something like BLACK (of course),
GREEN, RED, YELLOW, BLUE, CYAN, PINK and perhaps a few more.
<p>Well, today, thankfully, technology has moved on. But for some programmers,
the thinking hasn't. There are many SAS programmers today who think they
are still limited to these simple colors. HTML output, using such a limited
set of colors, looks unappealing. But there are many colors you can use
and indeed, even from old times, there were many colors you could specify
in SAS even if a "plotter" could not handle them. You can use up to 255
different colors in a single sas session and these are held in a "color
palette" (though anti-aliasing of "TrueType" fonts can take up about 40
or so of these slots). But <b>what are these colors called and how can
you find them?</b> This document will explain. After reading this document
you will be able to find all possible colors and even specify colors that
have no name and do it with confidence.
<h2>
Eight letter colors</h2>
If you create annotate datasets then your color field is limited to only
eight characters.&nbsp; There is no point specifying a color like "<b>AntiqueWhite</b>"
as "proc ganno" will complain that it does not know the color "<b>ANTIQUEW</b>"
and will tell you that it has mapped the color to another color (usually
"black"). There are a lot of pleasing colors to use these days like "AntiqueWhite"
and "DarkSlateGray" but how do you find a list of these colors and how
do you use them if you are limited to eight characters? It is possible
to do both. I will explain.
<h2>
Regedit and "CX" colors</h2>
If you have interactive SAS on your computer then start up a sas session
and in the command window (which you have maybe never used before - it
is in the top left corner under "File", "Edit", "View", "Tools" etc.) type
in "<b>regedit</b>" and press "Enter". A "<b>Registry Editor</b>" window
will appear. Expand out the "COLORNAMES" folder and it will show you an
"HTML" folder. Click on the HTML folder and a list of color names will
appear. I just did this and I see "<b>AliceBlue</b>" at the top of the
list. We'll find out what AliceBlue looks like shortly. But the
name is <b>nine</b> characters long so how can I use it? Well, I can. To
the right, in the "Data" column, it says "<b>F0, F8, FF</b>". These are
hex codes. They are the hex values of the <b>Red, Green, Blue</b> component
colors. It means that to make this color you need <b>F0</b> worth of <b>red</b>,
<b>F8</b>
worth of <b>green</b> and <b>FF</b> (the maximum) worth of <b>blue</b>.
You can specify this color as an eight character color as "<b>CXF0F8FF</b>".
The "<b>CX</b>" is always at the start and never changes and tells sas
that you are using the <b>RGB</b> color scheme (there are other schemes
but I will not go into them). To familiarize you a bit more with this scheme
then look down the list for "blue". It's not far below and is under "BlanchedAlmond"
on my screen. In the "Data" column for "blue" I see "<b>00, 00, FF</b>".
Again, these are the "red", "green", "blue" hex values so this is <b>00</b>
for <b>red</b>, <b>00</b>&nbsp; for <b>green</b> and <b>FF</b> (the maximum)
for <b>blue</b>. So "blue" is everything and "red" and "green" are nothing.
So instead of using the word "<b>blue</b>" I could specify this color as
"<b>CX0000FF</b>". Now look for "black". It is above "BlanchedAlmond" on
my screen and has the RGB hex values "00, 00, 00". That means zero amount
of the three colors and with zero amount of any of the three colors then
it is all dark or, in other words "black". "<b>Black</b>" can be specified
as "<b>CX000000</b>". What about "<b>white</b>"? Can you guess what its
three color codes are? You might not feel confident to guess at this stage
so scroll down (the colors are in alphabetical order) and you will see
that the RGB hex codes for "white" are "FF, FF, FF". In other words, the
maximum amount of all three colors. You could specify "white" as "CXFFFFFF".
Just at this point I would like to state that if the three RGB values are
the same such as "00, 00, 00" or "FF, FF, FF" or "C8, C8, C8" or whatever
then this is a "neutral color" or, in other words, a "shade of gray" with
a shade between "black" and "white". The higher the values, the more towards
"white" is the shade of gray.

<p>Before we finish this section, let's find out what the color "AliceBlue"
looks like. We can always test a color by setting "goptions" and using 
"proc gtestit". We could set the background color to be AliceBlue. There
is no need to use the CX code for this as long color names are accepted by
the goptions statement. Assuming your interactive sas session is still
active then run this code.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>goptions reset=all vpos=25 hpos=40 ftext='Arial/Bold' cback=AliceBlue;</tt>
<p><tt>proc gtestit picture=1;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you ran the above sas code you will see that the background of the 
graphics output is slightly blue. That is AliceBlue. It's a pale color that 
is hard to see. With a CX code of CXF0F8FF then this should be no big surprise
as it is not far off from being CXFFFFFF which is the code for "White". Change 
the goptions "cback" setting to "cback=AntiqueWhite" if you like, to compare. 
If you work with graphics in sas then you should get used to trying things out 
using "proc gtestit". It is your friend. I could write you a tool to try out
colors but you must get into the habit of using "proc gtestit" if you program
with graphics in sas.  It will help you learn a lot more.

<p>Note that although goptions can work with color names longer than eight
characters, and you could set ctext=DarkSlateBlue if you wanted to for the default
text color, if your annotate dataset tries to pick up that value as the default
then you will get a problem again in that the color name is longer than eight 
characters. I don't know why that should be - it seems like a bug to me - but we 
are stuck with it for now.

<h2>
Old-fashioned eight character sas colors</h2>
SAS has more than 255 colors you can refer to as a name of eight characters
or less. I bet you didn't know that. Maybe the reason you didn't know that
was because they didn't publicize it much so you have got to search them
out. The complete set of old-fashioned eight-or-less sas colors that were
kown of at the time can be seen if you Google "sas colors". The first page
on the list when I do this is the URL I want which is this one.
<p><a href="http://www.devenezia.com/docs/SAS/sas-colors.html" target="_blank">http://www.devenezia.com/docs/SAS/sas-colors.html</a>
<p>You will see a complete list of known old-fashioned sas colors plus
their "CX" codes. The same "CX" code is shown twice, side by side as black
and white, to make sure you can see at least one of these codes against
the background color which is the color it represents. Now, although you
might think you have discovered a treasure trove of colors here, I want
to warn you against something. I would ask you to scroll right down to
the end of the page. Just above the bottom five "greenish yellows" you
will see some of the "yellows" shades. Do you see them? Going upwards it
reads "moderate yellow", "light yellow", "deep yellow", "strong yellow",
"brilliant yellow" and "vivid yellow". Now, assuming you are not color
blind for these colors, I ask you - "<b>Do these shades look yellow to
you?</b>". Not for me. They look somewhat <b><i>greenish</i></b> to me!
So, although you have an abundance of eight-or-less character color name
you can use in your annotate datasets, it might not give you the colors
you think you are going to get.
<p>I have taken this same list of colors but knocked out some of the colors
that are very close to "black" without it being "black". I have also knocked
out a few very-near-white colors that for me are indistinguishable from
white and I have a cut down list at the URL below. To this list I have
added two "CX" grays that I made up plus three modern sas colors I got
from the COLORNAMES/HTML list (see the previous section) namely "linen",
"beige" and "wheat". These particular modern colors are good "<b>striping
colors</b>". I will explain what I mean by that later in this document.
My color page is at the following URL. On my page I have tried to sequence
the color shades. Where a color does not fit with the associated color
shades, such as "yellow" looking nothing like the other shades of "yellow",
then I have put this color near the start of the page.
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/sascolors.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/sascolors.html</a>
<p>Note that the text font on the page I created looks a bit ugly. I used
the font "swissb". That's not because I live in Switzerland (I do at the
time of writing) but because, as I mentioned in the Introduction, if I
used a TrueType font such as 'Times New Roman' then about 40 of the color
palette slots would have been used in anti-aliasing the font but I needed
all the color slots I could have. "Swissb" is a SAS software font that
does not need any of these color palette slots for anti-aliasing.
<p>If you are looking at the above page and the modern colors "linen",
"beige" and "wheat" are not clearly distinguishable, and you are not color
blind for these colors, then it means your monitor needs adjusting. Try
reducing the contrast and adjusting the brightness to compensate and the
colors should be distinguishable. It is important that you can distinguish
these colors for when you design output where you use "striping colors".
Don't worry - I'll explain what I mean by "striping colors" shortly.
<p>Now, before I leave this section, I want to assure you that creating
color displays as I have done in the page above is not complicated. I have
used some annotate macros that I wrote myself, but they are not complicated
either. Here is the code I used to produce the above output. Nervous to
look at it? Don't be!
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/sascolors.sas" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/sascolors.sas</a>
<p>You will see a call to <b>%rannomac</b> near the top of the code. This
is my own version of the SAS-Institute supplied sasautos member %annomac.
I just don't like using macros with a lot of positional parameters like
the ones in %annomac, as I can never remember the order of the parameters,
so I wrote my own macros with named parameters. And besides, I think my
macros are more useful for the sort of graphics work I do. You can link
to my annotate macros below. Again, you will see nothing complicated there.
Don't be afraid of SAS code that creates graphics. It is easier than you
think.

<h2>
More on "CX" colors</h2>
I want you, after reading this document, to have enough confidence to pick
the colors you want and define them as "CX" colors. Suppose you wanted
shades of "yellow". You might not be happy with the greenish-looking yellow
shades that you have seen above as the SAS-Institute supplied colors. I
want you to be able to choose your range of color shades and give them
the correct "CX" codes, after maybe a bit of playing around. At this point
you are probably thinking "<b>you're kidding me</b>". But after looking
at the next few pages I hope you will be able to tune in on these "CX"
colors and how to specify them. I have three pages below. All three pages
show exactly the same colors but do so in different sequences. These have
been generating using SAS code. The idea behind these pages is to show
you what "CX" colors look like what so you can both choose these colors
or make up your own "CX" value colors as you need to.
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolor1.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolor1.html</a>
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolor2.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolor2.html</a>
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolor3.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolor3.html</a>
<p>Impressive? How did I do it? Can a mere mortal program such a thing?
Guess what - it's easy! Here is the code I used to generate these pages.
I just had to change the "name" value for the macro variable and swap round
the order of "r", "g" and "b" in the "do loops" to produce the three different
pages.
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolors.sas" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxcolors.sas</a>
<p>What I want to happen with these color charts is for you to choose
the colors you want and if not using one of these colors directly, to choose
your own "CX" codes for them. You might have to do a bit of experimentation
but then you can base your code on the code links I give on this page.
Remember that you can always try out your colors using goptions and
"proc gtestit" as I showed you in a previous section. The "cback=" parameter
in the "goptions statement" will accept "CX" colors (don't enclose them in quotes).
<h2>
Color sequences</h2>
Part of the intention of creating the same "CX" colors in three different
sequences, as I did with the three pages above, was to help people pick
out "color sequences". And what I mean by that is a set of colors that
progress from one chosen color to another chosen color in a sequence. You
might want such a sequence to represent the "intensity" increasing of something.
I created this color page as part of the documentation on a graphical patient
profiler I am writing. I might need a color sequence that represnets the
intensity of a dose, for example, that I can use on the display. I guess
that whatever sequence of colors you come up with is going to be personal
- I'm not sure there is such a thing as a universally intuitive sequence
of colors - but whatever sequence you want I hope the three charts will
help you. As for going from one color to another then if you can't find
that sequence in those three charts going from left to right or from top
to bottom then you can maybe find a diagonal progression for what you want.
And if the colors are not quite right then maybe you will have anough confidence
with "CX" values to choose them yourself, now you have read this far. And,
of course, you can try it out using code, maybe using my code examples
as the basis.
<h2>
"Striping colors"</h2>
I promised you earlier that I would explain what I meant by "striping colors".
Here goes. It's nothing complicated. What I mean by "striping colors" is
background colors that help you look across detail lines from left to right
without your eye accidentally swapping up or down a line. On plain paper,
you might have faint ruled lines to do this. Ruled lines look cluttered
on html documents. They sort of add eye detail that you don't need. All
you need is to be able to scan across a line without dropping down to the
next line or jumping up to the higher line. The best thing for the eye
is a background shading color that is very light. "Beige" is a particularly
good color for this. If you stripe your detail lines alternately with "beige"
and "white" then it is easy for the eye to follow the line across and stay
on the same line while at the same time the "beige" color is not telling
the brain "you need to look at this". "Beige" is a good color for striping.
I highly recommend its use. But depending on the color scheme you are using,
"beige" might not be right for you. Since I think striping backgrounds
are important, especially for the graphical patient profiler I am currently
working on, I created three striping color pages that you can use to pick
out a "CX" striping color suitable for your color scheme. They follow below
and so does the code member I used to generate them.
<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxstrip1.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxstrip1.html</a>
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxstrip2.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxstrip2.html</a>
<br><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxstrip3.html" target="_blank">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/cxstrip3.html</a>
<p>OK, suppose you look at the graphics above and you pick a striping color
that you like. How do you actually go about using that color and producing
that stripe? Well, I did just that when I produced the above graphics.
I striped the background and then wrote the "CX" value on top. The code
that produced the above three examples is <b><i>simple.</i></b> You doubt
it? Feel you can face the code? Go on - take a risk!

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
In this document, you were introduced to the many colors that are available
for html display using sas, where you can find them and how you can specify
them using "CX" colors. You were introduced to the full range of colors
that is possible using "CX" codes and it was explained how they work to
the extent that you can specify whatever color you wish as a "CX" color.
"Striping colors", such that they can help you scan detail lines from left
to right, were explained and many examples given.
