<h1>
Worst-case EPOCH merging with SDTM and ADaM</h1></center>
<b>Last updated: 26 Feb 2014</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This page covers the very difficult topic of assigning "worst-case" period
identifiers to events where, due to a partial date for an event, or a non-exact
datetime value for an interval boundary, or lack of an exact definition
that can be taken from a CRF page, an event can be assigned to two (or
more)&nbsp; periods and so we have to assign the period for the "worst
case". You will see a thorough description of this problem on this page
plus the solution. The very final step in the solution, for SDTM, is left
for you to complete at the end as a carefully guided exercise. Be prepared
to put in some quality time for this. This is not a subject you can possibly
gloss over and get a good result out of.
<p>It is assumed the reader will be familiar with a CRF (Case Report Form
- whether paper or electronic) and will have an understanding of "pages"
of the CRF and how these might relate to the different periods of the study.
This is because sometimes the "pages" of a CRF can precisely indicate a
study period if it is designed in such a way. There will be discussion
of this in following sections.
<p>You will see the abbreviation "AE" in a few places. This is short for
"Adverse Event". "Adverse Event" is like a bad thing happening to your
health like having a sneezing fit (as a mild example).
<h2>
CRF page numbers - knowing when you know</h2>
The <b>page</b> on which information is collected on a CRF (whether electronic
or not) can sometimes precisely identify the study period it belongs to.
Suppose your screening details collection starts on page 10 but before
that you collect AE information on page 9. In this case it should be obvious
that the AE information is for pre-screening. So suppose you have an AE
entered on page 9 for the date of 21Nov012 and that is in the morning of
that very day and the screening starts on 21Nov2012 that morning then when
processing AE data then in which period does it belong to - screening or
pre-screening. In this case it is obvious from the CRF design - it is pre-screening
because details were entered before data collection for screening.
<p>If it is clear what period an event belongs to by virtue of its CRF
page then it should be labelled as such. And if labelled then no attempt
should be made to change it. There are computer systems that take in AE
data collected over various pages and try to assign a treatment period
based on a "worst case" scenario. This is only justified where the period
is unknown. But it could be obvious from the page number due to the CRF
design. This is where a lot of computer systems for creating SDTM data
are going wrong. They are recalculating the period label when it is already
implicit from the CRF page number. Typically, the data will be coming through
with EPOCH as a blank variable with an AE date and an absent page number.
This gets compared with interval start and end dates and it is up to the
program to assign the "worst case" period label where the AE date sits
on the date boundary of interval change. "Worst case" will be to assign
it to "screening" rather than "pre-screening" if it lies on this interval
boundary yet when the AE data was collected, its CRF page number might
have precisely indicated that it was a pre-screening AE that happened on
the morning before screening started. People who use computer systems for
creating SDTM data and those who write them need to be aware that sometimes
the assignment of period labels is being done and choices made even though
there should be no choice to make as it is already implicit from the page
number.
<p>So remember, CRF page numbers might dictate what period an event belongs
to. In this case <b>it should be supplied</b> to any computer system and
the computer system should not attempt to recalculate it. Especially if
it can be derived from a CRF page number and this page number is not supplied
with the data, should this be done. <b>What follows on this page is for
situations where the treatment period is genuinely uncertain for an event
and the period for the "worst case" scenario needs to be assigned.</b>
<h2>
Check up on this "CRF page number" issue</h2>
Check up on this "CRF page number" issue before reading any further. I
want to make it clear that the rest of this page is to do with assigning
worst case periods to events where it is <b>genuinely uncertain</b> what
period it belongs to due to lack of qualifying information.
<p>Here is how things can get messed up when Data Managers talk to programmers.
Data Managers will choose to talk to programmers in terms that they feel
the programmer will be comfortable with. They know that programmers have
difficulty grasping the implications of a CRF structure so they avoid this
complexity.
<p>So the Data Manager says to the programmer <b>"For events that lie on
an interval boundary and it is uncertain in which period the event falls
then assign on a worst case basis"</b>.
<p>What they were thinking when they were saying that was <b>"For events
that lie on an interval boundary and it is uncertain in which period the
event falls (e.g. because from the page number alone you can not determine
with certainty that it belonged to a particular period) then assign on
a worst case basis"</b>. They assume the programmer understood their thinking
because they did not look puzzled or ask questions and you emailed them
the annotated CRF at least a month ago and they did not come back with
any questions on that either.
<p>The programmer, not being able to read the Data Manager's mind and not
having had the time nor the inclination to read some annotated CRF sent
to them at least a month ago, thinks that all they said and meant was <b>"For
events that lie on an interval boundary and it is uncertain in which period
the event falls then assign on a worst case basis"</b>. And then they set
out to accurately reassign periods (even though, unknown to them, they
are already precisely known based on the CRF page number).
<h2>
The annotated CRF - a diversion</h2>
Excuse me if I diverge off-topic for a few seconds and have a small bitch
about the way clinical programmers ignore the annotated CRF ...
<p>Early in my clinical reporting career I was once asked to report a study
in a short time. I asked what standard macros I should use to do this and
in response to my question I was handed an annotated CRF and told that
I should do it on that basis. I did it. Understanding an annotated CRF
and what information is given across implicitly in its structure is something
of a lost art among clinical programmers these days. It is a shame because
it gives you a good understanding of the data - and only having a good
understanding of the data should programmers be analysing and reporting
on it.
<p>What is worse, these days, is that data being passed over to programs
to produce reports has been semi-transformed into SDTM format and sometimes
important information like CRF page numbers has been dropped and hence
implicit defining information is lost. The page number was never a "measurement"
so it is not "data" as such, but it was "data about data" or "metadata".
This "metadata" tells you something about your data - and sometimes this
is important - and sometimes this is being thrown away.
<p>Oh well, I guess that is progress for you ...
<p>This little diversion is over - now back to the topic.
<h2>
If you find out that the "CRF page number" issue is an issue</h2>
If you find that that indeed, the CRF page numbers in some cases precisely
define a study period then make sure that these are already labelled as
they come in and you check on this label and do not recalculate if this
label is already set. You maybe have a generic program and with this generic
program it is impossible or undesirable to give consideration to individual
study CRF design and its page numbers but this should not be an excuse
to recalculate. Just insist that the data coming in has the period labelled
if it is known and then do not recalculate if the period label already
has a value.
<h2>
And so, off into the wilderness ...</h2>
Assuming these previous issues have been settled and you are reading the
rest of this page because you genuinely have situations where the study
period is unknown then we venture out into the wilderness and discuss the
various complications. You should take this slowly and not skip over any
parts it. Make sure you totally understand each part before moving onto
the next stage. This is going to get <b>very complicated</b> but you will
see that the solution to it is both simple to understand and apply once
you thoroughly understand the situation.
<h2>
Non-exact period boundaries</h2>
Each subject will have information about when study periods started and
ended. Period starts, as defined, are never "partial", though they may
be non-exact in the sense that they are missing s start time. For example,
"screening" may start on the date of 21JUN2013. This is non-exact as it
does not tell you what <b>time</b> on that date it started. Before the
date of 21JUN2013 it is "pre-screening", post 21JUN2013 then it is in the
screening period or beyond, but what about an AE (Adverse Event) that happens
on 21JUN2013 or even if it happened on 21JUN2013 and the time was precisely
known? Then does this AE belong to the pre-screening or screening period?
If we do not have information about which study period this AE happened
(typically got from the CRF page) then we have to assign on a worst case
basis.
<p>But typically, although "screening" only has a start date - in contrast
- "start of treatment" will likely has a date and a precise time (from
which you can combine into a <b>datetime</b> values in SAS).
<p>The problem with this scenario where you have a mixture of study period
start dates with start datetimes is that it makes it more complicated to
match an event timepoint to the study period. The event timepoint may be
just a date. It also might be a precise datetime value. You are then trying
to match this with a mixture of interval start dates and datetime values.
This is a challenge.
<p>Another challenge is that the end of interval might not have happened
yet (because they are still on treatment, to give an obvious example) and
so you need to plug the end time or datetime.
<p>Basically, you interval data needs to be changed into something more
useful before you can use it for merging event data with.
<p>Now this is getting <b>complicated</b>. But, as promised, the solution
is quite <b>simple</b>.
<p>Here is the solution. For pure interval boundary dates then to turn
them into datetime values we have to make sure the end date overlaps the
same following begin date. Remember that these dates are the same. For
that to work then we add a time value of 23:59:59.9 to the end date and
a value of 00:00:00.0 to the following start date. That way, any datetime
value for an event on that day can fall into both periods.
<p>The solution for pure dates is to use the dates as they stand and for
when we have datetime interval starts then to use just the datepart of
that. When matching on date periods we allow "less than or equal to" for
the end of the period whereas for datetime values we are more strict and
match on "less than" the end of the period. This is no big deal when we
have generated end datetimes from pure dates as being right at the end
of the day (23:59:59.9).
<p>Below you can see some code where I have taken interval data and derived
dates and datetimes from it and plugged missing end dates and datetimes.
Please take the time to carefully think about it. This is what you are
going to have to do with your interval data to make it useful and you need
to know what you are doing and why you are doing it.

<h2>
Worseness</h2>
I we are going to assign events that fall into two periods (or perhaps
more) then we need to know the "worseness" value for each of the periods.
Obviously, if on study drug, then that has a higher "worseness" value than
not being on the study drug. For a very simple scenario of pre-screening,
screening, on-treatment, post-treatment, post-study you could give it worseness
value of (I like to give study drug periods a multiple of "5" so be warned)
pre-screening=0, screening=1, on-treatment=5, post-treatment=1, post-study=0.
I hard-coded it in the above code. What I would like is to be able to pick
up these "worseness" values from the people who are giving me the data.
It might not be simple as in the case I just described.
<p>Here is another situation - we have pre-screening, screening, placebo-run-in,
on-treatment, tapered-wash-out, post-treatment, post-study. What do we
do here with our worseness values? I am guessing pre-screening=0, screening=1,
placebo-run-in=2, on-treatment=5, tapered-wash-out= I don't have a clue!
If something happened in tapered wash-out then is that worse than it happening
on-treatment? I don't have a clue. That is why I need to get this information
from somebody who knows the study. I need to pick it up somehow. Maybe
that could be in the treatment arm data. Maybe it should be in the interval
data. I would be happier if it were in the interval data for the subject
just in case "worst case" is dependent on more complicated treatment regimens
like for a cross-over study.
<p>But whatever, if we are to assign "worse case" programmatically, somehow,
then we need to have somehow a "worseness" value for the study periods
such that we can select "worst case" if there is more than one period.
<h2>
Partial event dates</h2>
You can get partial event dates and you may need to map these to a "worse
case". You may have the day of the month missing for the date if it is
an AE. You may have a minute missing in some rare cases. If the event date
is partial then it will cover a range of possibilities. There will be a
"low-high" range for these. You need to consider the whole range is you
are assigning worst case. We need something to give us that range in the
case of partial dates. But if the date or datetime value is not partial
then we would expect bit high and low values to be the same.
<p>This is quite a complicated topic but fortunately the code is already
written to give this range as "--HI" and "--LO" values in the form of DATELO,
DATEHI, TIMELO, TIMEHI, DTTMLO, DTTMHI and the macro is called <a href="Spectre/utilmacros/fixiso8601.sas" target="_blank">%fixiso8601</a>
. This also adds a variable <b>_obsno</b> which is set to the observation
count <b>_n_</b> that we will need to use.
<p>The above macro only currently works for the simple case where you have
a text datetime of the form yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.ss
<p>You will need to use a macro like %fixiso8601 to ensure your event dates
are given appropriate ranges if partial. All the observations need to go
through such a routine to give high and low values even though you may
only have a few partial dates.
<p>Just to remind you, the %fixiso8601 macro only deals with text ISO 8601
datetime of the format <b>yyyy-mm-ddThh.mm.ss.ss</b> . However, so long
as you can convert your own ISO 8601 text value into the same format then
the macro should work for you. Please read and understand the disclaimer
at the end of the macro header (applicable for all my macros). Just because
it works well for me does not mean that in all cases it will work well
for you.
<p>Before we move on to the next very important topic, to do with overlapping
intervals, then I want to remind you what %fixiso8601 is doing. It give
you range values from --LO to --HI. This is an interval. We are going to
work out&nbsp; way of detecting overlapping intervals in the next section.
Using %fixiso8601 for non-partial values will mean that the --LO values
are the same as the --HI values but you need to still regard this as an
interval, except the interval has zero width. It still applies when we
need to detect overlapping intervals.
<h2>
Overlapping Intervals</h2>
<b>This is the most important topic on this page</b>. We will start with
a very simple formula that can detect when two intervals overlap. We will
have to change it, however, to cope with our situations. Although it is
simple, you have got to thoroughly understand it such that you can make
it work for you in various ways and that you are able to augment it with
extra conditions when you need to.
<p>What follows is the basic formula, that you can find using an Internet
search, that we will have to amend slightly.

<p>If we use the formula for the above cases then in Case 1, b.start is
not less than a.end so we don not have an overlap. In Case 2 then a.start
is not less than b.end so we do not have a overlap. In the other cases
the condition is satisfied and we have overlaps.
<p>We need to change the formula for boundary effects. For date intervals
then the start and end days, if they are the same, can belong to both periods
and so they can be considered to be overlapping.

<p>We need to change the formula again for datetime boundaries and we need
to distinguish between a study period and an event period. This is because
for the study interval end then we only have overlap if it is less than
this value. This is because of the precise nature of the boundary. You
will see why in the following cases. See how the formula has changed. Where
an event interval is just a single upright line then this means that it
is not partial and has a zero width interval.

<p>Now that we have had to distinguish between study intervals and event
intervals then our two algorithms can be stated as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>DATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intervals overlap when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&lt; STUDY.END) and (STUDY.START &lt;= EVENT.END)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now that we are clear on the algorithms to use, you will see this used
in the following code. The code above is repeated at the start of the code
below. You will see that this is followed by a call to %fixiso8601, followed
by the SQL join using the above algorithms. You will see that I match on
date or datetime depending on the length of the ISO 8601 text string. Note
than in the SQL I am imputing start dates and start datetimes. This is
something normally done for ADaM and not SDTM. The output dataset is ordered
(sorted) by <b>_obsno</b> (put there by the %iso8601 macro) and <b>worseness</b>
that will ensure uniqueness. Finally, only the worse case is kept for when
we have multiple periods for an original input observation number. This
assumes that one of the periods definitely has the highest "worseness"
value. For more complicated cases then you might have to order (sort) in
a different way.

<h2>
The SDTM vs. ADaM difference</h2>
What you see in the above code is typical for ADaM and not SDTM. ADaM are
analysis datasets and so if we had a partial event date and this had a
possibility of falling in two or more periods then we would pick the worst
case. We would then impute a start date as the maximum of the event start
date and the worst case period start date and similarly for the imputed
start datetime. This is what you can see in the code above and should be
useful to you for programming ADaM datasets. However, it is not useful
for SDTM.
<p>For SDTM data, since this is not analysis data, then we normally do
not impute dates. If we have a range of dates or datetimes due to a partial
event date or datetime then we do not pick one of them to use as an identifier
to match on epoch. However, we can still sometimes deal with ranges and
we can still choose worst case in some circumstances, as I will explain.
<p>Firstly, we deal with a range of dates. Suppose you had a partial event
date of --Jul2012. In that case then if the whole of July of that year
was contained in a single study period then you are safe to match on that
study period epoch. But if it could fall into two different periods then
you would not assign the epoch as this is for SDTM and not ADaM and so
you are not allowed to impute the date or even choose part of the range
of dates.
<p>Secondly, we deal with single dates. If we know the date then we are
not imputing the date. It is fixed. But if that date falls on a study period
date boundary then because the end and start dates of the periods are shared,
we choose the worst case! It all hangs on this idea of not imputing dates.
We do our best to assign periods and worst case but it is never done on
the basis of imputing a date or choosing part of a possible range. This
is the difference between SDTM and ADaM data. For ADaM you impute dates
- for SDTM you do not impute dates.
<p>So we are ready to recode the SQL join for SDTM by adding extra conditions.
We will match on a range only if the whole range fits inside a single period.
As for it being a single date that lies on a boundary then this condition
will be automatically met (though you should think that through to convince
yourself).

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have been given a thorough introduction to study and event interval
periods, the overlapping of periods and the assignment of "worst-case"
epochs for both SDTM and ADaM.
