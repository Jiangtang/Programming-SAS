<h1>
Moving PDF bookmarks using SAS v9.2</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>
<br><b>Updated: 19 Aug 2012</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
When I started using SAS in September 1986 then the sort of reports you
could produce were very limited by their presentation. Pure ascii reports
printed out on a dot matrix printer being the norm. But over the years,
with the introduction of ODS plus other enhancements, SAS output reporting
has improved greatly. Adobe PDF is the industry accepted way these days
of formatting reports for users and SAS is very capable of doing this.
One of the limitations up until SAS v9.2 is the ability to move PDF bookmarks.
Now you might think that moving PDF bookmarks is a nice thing to have but
not a necessary requirement but some times it really is needed. Imagine
a situation where a user is uploading batches of files to a central database
location. The want a report back telling them, on the first page, what
files were loaded and what not and if the loads were clean, or done with
warnings or not at all due to an error condition. Then for each file submitted
they want to see a file summary report of the checks done and the results
for each check. Then for each individual check that produced warnings or
errors they will want to see the diagnostics.
<p>Now if we think of the situation above then if a user has submitted
6 files then each file might have on average 10 diagnostic listing so that
being the case then with the overall summary, the 6 individual file summaries
with the 10, on average, diagnostic listings for each then we have a PDF
containing 67 reports. You would not want all 67 reports with bookmarks
all at the same level. You would want the overall summary report as the
first page, followed by each individual file summary, making 7 bookmarks
in total, and underneath each individual file summary hold the 10, on average,
diagnostic listings. <b>7 top level bookmarks is good - 67 top level bookmarks
is bad.</b>
<p>When SAS produces reports then each is an independent thing. There is
currently no way to tell it what report should be subordinate to what higher
level report. I think there should be. We don't even have that with SAS
v9.2 - but what we do have since SAS v9.2 is <b>the ability to move bookmarks
around</b> and this can be done <b>programmatically</b>.
<p>I must warn you that this page is going to be long. You should not read
it unless you think you will have to do the job of creating reporting PDFs
using SAS and that you will need to move bookmarks around and "nest" them
to make your PDF reports more presentable. I will have to introduce this
method gradually because there are a few things you have to know about
before you can tackle this job.
<br>PDF reports are simpler than Ascii reports
<h2>
Unlearning PROC REPORT</h2>
You maybe spent years learning the ins-and-outs of proc report, Well, when
it comes to using it for producing PDF reports, then to a large extent
you have to <b>unlearn</b> most of what you learned.
<p><b>This is what you have to unlearn about PROC REPORT:</b>
<p>You learned about setting column widths - <b>forget about column widths</b>
- for PDFs you are better off not specifying this at all because it will
be ignored in any case. There is a way of doing this but you should avoid
using it. Just let "proc report" handle it.
<p>You learned about "flow" - <b>forget about "flow"</b> - for PDFs then
SAS will use <b>flow</b> in any case whether you want it to or not so do
not specify it.
<p><b>Forget about the COLUMN statement</b> - just like "proc print", you
do not need to list the variables you intend to report to "proc report".
Just like "proc print", it will print whatever variables it finds in the
input dataset in variable position order. To get your variables in the
order you want then define them in the order you want. With SQL then your
"select" order of variables is the variable order. With data steps you
can use a LENGTH statement to define the order of variables. Just create
your dataset or SQL table with the variables in the order you want them
reported. Sometimes you will need to use a "column" statement but this
should be an exception rather than the rule.
<p><b>Forget about "define"-ing every variable to "proc report".</b> You
can define just one variable, if you want, as "order noprint", with no
"column" variables listed, and "proc report" will treat that one variable
in that way and display the rest.
<p>So what sort of form of "proc report" should you be aiming at for producing
PDFs? Well how about this? Notice the use of "<b>&amp;memname</b>" and
"<b>&amp;memlabel</b>". I pulled these values out of <b>dictionary.tables</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ods proclabel " ";</tt>
<br><tt>title1 "&amp;memlabel";</tt>
<br><tt>footnote1;</tt>
<p><tt>proc report nowd data=&amp;memname contents="&amp;memlabel";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define holder / order noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; break before holder / page contents="";</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you look at the simple code above then you can see I have used no
"column" statement but I have defined the variable "<b>holder</b>" as "<b>order
noprint</b>" and I break before it to set <b>contents=" "</b>. This is
a technique you will have to use when creating PDFs with bookmarks.
<p>But what about the title of the report? Each different printed table
is going to need a different title, surely? <b>Sure it does!</b> But then
why not put the report title in the dataset label and pull it out of <b>dictionary.tables</b>
and assign it to a macro variable (<b>memlabel</b>) and use that? This
is an important technique you need to use for generic PDF creation.
<p>Below you see me creating a reporting dataset and putting its title
("Additional information found") in the dataset label:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>create table &amp;subnm._det31(label="Additional information found")
as</tt>
<br><tt>select distinct analyte label="ANALYTE", pkmatrix label="PKMATRIX",
1 as holder</tt>
<br><tt>from &amp;subnm as a</tt>
<br><tt>where not exists</tt>
<br><tt>(select 1 from crosschk.&amp;sample as b</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;where a.analyte=b.analyte and a.pkmatrix=b.pkmatrix);&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>... and somewhere else in my code I pull the title out of <b>dictionary.tables</b>
and then assign it to a macro variable of the same name using my <b>%getvalue</b>
macro. I then resolve it in the "title" statement:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; create table listfiles as&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select memname, memlabel</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; from dictionary.tables&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where libname eq 'WORK' and</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobs gt 0 and</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; index(memname,"&amp;subnm._DET")
EQ 1;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<p><tt>%do l=1 %to %nobs(listfiles);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let memname=%getvalue(listfiles,memname,&amp;l);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let memlabel=%getvalue(listfiles,memlabel,&amp;l);</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; ods proclabel " ";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; title1 "&amp;memlabel";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; footnote1;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; proc report nowd data=&amp;memname contents="&amp;memlabel";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; define holder / order noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break before holder / page contents="";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The three levels of PDF bookmarks and the "holder" variable</h2>
There is nothing magic about a variable named <b>"holder"</b>. The reason
I stick to using that name is because of a very important SAS paper that
was written. If you want to control PDF bookmarks (and at some stage you
will) then you <b>must</b> read the following paper, starting at page 9.
<p><a href="http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings11/246-2011.pdf" target="_blank">Changing
nodes in an ODS PDF bookmark using the Document Procedure</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(scroll down to page 9)
<p>This paper is what started me down the path of seeking to control and
move PDF bookmarks and if you intend to produce nice user-friendly PDF
reports using SAS then you have to go down that path too.
<p>The "<b>holder</b>" variable (it could have any other valid variable
name but I will stick to "holder") is used as a "trick" to wipe out the
lowest level bookmark, thus leaving us with the two levels we want. It
is used to stop you seeing the label "Table 1" as a PDF bookmark label
when you produce output using "proc report". You don't get that with "proc
print" but we are not going to use "proc print" because with SAS v9.2 "ods
document" it will give you an annoying warning message. Besides, "proc
report" is more flexible than "proc print" and hopefully, this warning
message will disappear with later releases of SAS.
<p><b>So what is this "holder" variable used for and how? </b>You see it
in the code above in the box. The three PDF bookmark level labels are related
to the value assigned to "proclabel" (the top level) and "contents" at
the proc report line level (the middle level) and "contents" at the variable
break level (the bottom level). If you set up a holder level and give it
the same value (such as numeric 1) then you can "break before holder" and
throw a page and set contents="" and this will get rid of the lowest level
"Table 1" label.
<p>With the lowest level label removed, by always using the "holder" variable
as seen above, then we are left with the two levels. To place our output
at the highest level then we need to set "proclabel" to the label we want
to see in the PDF bookmark and use contents="" on the "proc report" call
line. To place our output at the middle level we set "proclabel" to a space
(as is done above) and set "contents" to a value in the "proc report" line
(also as done above).
<p>That sums it up for the three levels of PDF bookmark. We get rid of
the lowest level using "holder" and choose the highest or middle level.
If you want to move a bookmark to have it subordinate to a high level bookmark
then you should create it as a middle level bookmark. How to move it will
be described later.
<p>Before you finish reading this section then I will remind you of how
to create a top level and middle level PDF bookmark. It is to do with "proclabel"
and "contents".
<p>This is for a <b>top level bookmark:</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ods proclabel "put-something-in-here";</tt>
<p><tt>proc report nowd data=&amp;memname contents="";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define holder / order noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; break before holder / page contents="";</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This is for a <b>middle level bookmark</b> (the ones we might want to
move)<b>:</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ods proclabel " ";</tt>
<p><tt>proc report nowd data=&amp;memname contents="put-something-in-here";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define holder / order noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; break before holder / page contents="";</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For a <b>"starting" middle level bookmark </b>where you have a table
that will be the first mid-level table of a group of other tables and you
are going to move other tables to sit alongside with then you have to specify
both proclabel and contents like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ods proclabel "put-something-in-here-to-act-as-a-label-for-all-the-reports";</tt>
<p><tt>proc report nowd data=&amp;memname contents="put-something-in-here";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define holder / order noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; break before holder / page contents="";</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What you specify in "proclabel" and "contents" will be what is displayed
in the PDF bookmarks and what will end up in the "label" variable of the
document "Properties" dataset that will be explained later.
<p>Back to the holder variable - should you add it to every reporting dataset
you create when you create it or add it in an extra step before you produce
a report using a "retain" statement in a data step?
<p><b>Good question!</b> I don't have a strong recommendation because I
have only been working on this for a few months, but looking to the future,
I would recommend putting it in the dataset when you create it. The reason
why? - well if you consider that I am already writing the report title
as the dataset label, and since "holder" will never be displayed, then
its label space could come in useful. If I know that some of the variables
in the dataset (table) I want to report are "<b>define ---- / order order=internal
noprint</b>" then I could write them to the "holder" variable label as
a space-delimited list and pull them out of "<b>dictionary.columns</b>"
before it prints and loop through the list and do the "define"s. And if
I were really clever then I could use a "<b>;</b>" after this list as a
scan character and put something else useful after the "<b>;</b>" like
to tell it to override variable labels (which "proc report" always gives
you unless you precede it with "options nolabel;" and reset with "options
label;" afterwards). Extracting the contents of this label is easy. You
do it the same way I did to extract the title written away to the dataset
label that I showed you in the previous section in the last code box at
the start, creating a table and using %getvalue, except you are extracting
from "dictionary.columns" instead. With a bit of ingenuity you could fully
automate report production when you call "proc report".
<h2>
ods document name=mydoc(write)</h2>
If you intend to move your bookmarks then you should not write to a PDF
using "ods PDF". Instead, you need to write to an "<b>ods document</b>"
and then later use "<b>proc document</b>" to list out your document contents,
prepare your "move" and "delete" statements for manipulating the bookmarks,
then call "proc document" again to apply the bookmark changes and <b>after
that</b>, while still in the "proc document" call, "<b>replay</b>" to "ods
PDF". The syntax is simply what you see in this section header except "mydoc"
will be any name you choose. When you are done writing to the document
then you close with "ods document close;" as you would expect.
<p>Assuming you wrote your "move" and "delete" lines of code to a temporary
file you set up like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>*--- sas code will be written to this temporary file ---;</tt>
<br><tt>filename movecode TEMP;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>....... and then use it as output using a "<b>file movecode;</b>" statement
in your data step and write to it using "put"s like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp; *--- generate the directory move and delete statements ---;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retain target "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; length movestr $ 40;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set doc_properties;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file movecode;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if scan(path,2,"\") EQ " " and input(subpad(label,1,4),??comma13.)
> 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or scan(path,2,"\") EQ " " and index(label,"valid
combinations")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then target=substr(path,2);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if scan(path,2,"\") NE " " and label ne
" "</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and target ne " " and scan(path,1,"\")
NE target then do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; movestr="move "||trim(substr(path,2))||"
to "||trim(target)||";";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put movestr;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; movestr="delete "||scan(path,1,"\")||";";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put movestr;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KEEP movestr;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>...... then you "include" the code in the "proc document" procedure
and then "replay" to your final PDF like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>*--- apply the directory move and delete statements then replay
to a PDF ---;</tt>
<br><tt>proc document name=exdoc;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %INCLUDE movecode;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ods pdf file=&amp;pdffile style=BarrettsBlue pdftoc=1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; replay;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ods pdf close;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Treat "ods document" the same as "ods PDF"</h2>
Because we are not going to write directly to "ods PDF", but rather to
"ods document" instead then I want to make it clear that <b>it acts as
the same thing</b>. You should think of "ods document" as "ods PDF" and
use whatever formatting styles that you would want to use in a PDF such
as setting "escapechar" as "^" and using "^S={}" notation to set styles
in the text. Your final output will have the same look using "ods document"
replayed to a PDF as if you wrote to a PDF directly.
<p>Carry on as normal with the sort of stuff you see below:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ods escapechar="^";</tt>
<p><tt>footnote1 "^S={color=red}Warning^S={}: Nice red warning.";</tt>
<p><tt>footnote2 "^S={textdecoration=underline fontstyle=italic}Note^S={}:
More fancy formatting.";</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Extracting the document contents</h2>
"Proc document" will list out the contents of your document but of course
you need it in dataset form. No problem. You can use "ODS TRACE" to tell
you its ods output location it is writing to. I will save you the bother
of running "ods trace" and tell you that it writes this information to
a location name "Properties" so you can route this to a dataset name of
your choosing like this ( I've included the "ods document close;" at the
start to remind you that you need to close it after you have finished writing
to it):
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ods document close;</tt>
<p><tt>*--- write the document contents to a dataset ---;</tt>
<br><tt>ods output Properties=doc_properties;</tt>
<p><tt>proc document name=mydoc;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; list / details levels=all;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<p><tt>ods output close;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Coding the "moves" and "deletes"</h2>
I can't help you to code the "move"s and "delete"s except to say that you
must "move" before you "delete" a directory. You can see an example above
that worked for me for one job but it will not be suitable for your circumstances.
You need to look at your "Properties" dataset that comes out of "proc document"
and make sense of it and decide what you need to do. The paper you can
link to above should be a help in understanding what you need to do for
the "move"s and "delete"s to give you what you want. You will need to play
around with this using trial and error as I did.
<p>However, I will try to explain what my code is doing and reference the
SAS paper so you can get an idea of how you have to code it. I have put
my same code below.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>First I will explain the lines of code before the <b>"if scan"</b> line.
<p>I use "data _null_" because I am writing to a temporary file with the
fileref "movecode" and not creating a sas dataset.
<p>I retain a string "target" which is the node I will be "move"ing my
reports to.
<p>The length of "movestr" is set long enough to contain my "move" and
"delete" instructions I will generate.
<p>The dataset properties are in the dataset "doc_properties". The variables
in this dataset you are intested in are named "path" and "label". "Label"
contains the test you defined to "proclabel" or "contents" when you created
your output dataset as I showed you above. The "path" variable contains
contents such as "\Report #1" for a top level report and "\Report #1\Report
#1" for a mid level report.
<p>I am witing the "move" and "delete" instructions to a temporary file
with fileref "movecode" and not a dataset so I can "include" this file
in a following "proc document" step so I have a line "file movecode;" so
that my "put"s are written to this file.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>OK, that was the easy part. Now we come to the logic of the "move"s
and "delete"s starting at the <b>"if scan"</b> line.
<p>I am only going to move a report a mid level report to sit under a top
level node. A top level node has a path like <b>"\Report #1"</b>. To move
it you move it to that location minus the starting "\". If what you are
moving has the path <b>"\Report #2\Report #1"</b> then your "move" statement
would be <b>"move Report #2\Report #1 to Report #1;"</b>. Note that the
starting "\" has been removed and it ends with a semicolon. And now you
have moved the report you no longer want the node that contained the report
so you would delete it with "<b>delete Report #2;</b>". Again note that
the starting "\" is removed and it ends with a semicolon.
<p>The "label" variable contains whatever you specified to "proclabel"
or "contents". If you followed the recommendation above then for top level
tables the "label" variable will be populated from "proclabel" for single
paths such as "\Report #1". For mid-level tables it will be populated from
"contents" for mid-level paths such as "\Report #2\Report #1". For <b>"starting"
mid-level tables</b> it will be populated for both the top level path like
"\Report #13" from "proclabel" and also for the "starting" mid-level path
"\Report #13\Report #" from "contents" . Note that you would never want
to move a "starting" mid-level table because it is already in the right
place. You would only move other tables to sit alongside it.
<p>Just to take a break at this point - the above is pretty hard to follow
or remember but will be easier if you list out your properties dataset
and get a feel for this. Don't worry if it seems difficult at this stage
as it will all make sense once you have spent some time looking at your
own properties dataset.
<p>Now back to the logic of the code. I have <b>two types of "move"s</b>
to do. I have some top level reports that I want to move mid levels reports
under and I have some starting mid level reports that I want to move other
reports alongside.
<p>I am always moving reports to sit under a top node (the "target") and
a top node will only have a one-piece path name like "\Report#1" so to
get this target I check that it is a one piece path using '<b>if scan(path,2,"\")
EQ " " '.</b>
<p>I have top level reports that are file summary reports and the first
4 characters are a number so I use "<b>input(subpad(label,1,4),??comma13.)
> 0</b><tt>"</tt> to detect this.
<p>I have top level nodes that have a "starting" mid level report and I
detect these with <b>' index(label,"valid combinations") '.</b>
<p>OK, we have identified and set the<b> targets</b> for the moves and
"retained" that in a variable named "target". Now for the moves themselves.
<p>What needs moving will have a two piece path name plus it will have
the variable "label" set to a value (assuming you followed my recommendations
above). The exception being a "starting" mid level table because it is
already in the right place. So I need to test that the second part of the
path name is present using <b>' if scan(path,2,"\") NE " " '</b> and that
there is something in the label field using <b>' label ne " " '</b> and
that there is a target to move to using <b>' target ne " " ' </b>and also
checking for "starting" mid level reports that it is not already at the
target location using <b>' scan(path,1,"\") NE target '</b>. If a report
satisfies these conditions then I move it using <b>' "move "||trim(substr(path,2))||"
to "||trim(target)||";" '</b>and delete the node it was in using <b>' "delete
"||scan(path,1,"\")||";" '.</b>
<p>This may seem overwhelming right now but it will eventually make sense
once you experiment with your own "properties" dataset.

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
What has been described on this page is the very different approach needed
to produce PDF reports using SAS and how the PDF bookmarks can be assigned
