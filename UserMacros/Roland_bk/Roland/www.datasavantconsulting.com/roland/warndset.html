<h1>
A "Warnings" dataset and Reporting it</h1></center>
<b>Author: Roland Rashleigh-Berry</b>
<br><b>Updated: 15 Apr 2013</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
A non-technical user may "own" a sas job that runs automatically in a system
and if there are any errors or warnings they will need to know about them
but maybe they do not have the skills to look in the sas job log and find
out what is going wrong. In these cases it is better if they can be sent
a report of all error or warning conditions that happened while the job
ran instead of expecting them to look through the log. This errors and
warnings report may take the form of an Excel file or a PDF or both. If
in PDF form then it is better if it is of publication quality with the
output split into separate pages per category, each with its own bookmark.
At the time of writing, in April 2013, this appears to be an emerging standard
in the industry.
<p>On this page you will see how this can be done in the simplest and most
efficient way.
<h2>
The SQL solution</h2>
A "warnings" dataset is more easily set up in SQL than using a data step.
This is because using a data step we will get a single observation with
missing values unless we remember to "trick" the data step into not writing
out an observation using something like "<b>if 0 = 1 then output;</b>".
And when it comes to updating the warnings dataset then SQL has the advantage
of being able to "<b>insert</b>" directly into it compared to writing to
a temporary dataset and using "proc append" to append to the warnings dataset.
SQL wins on both counts. It is also more concise and therefore should be
easier to understand and maintain so what you will see on this page is
the SQL solution rather than a data step solution.
<h2>
The Task</h2>
To illustrate the creation of the warnings dataset, the echoing of the
warnings to the log and its formatting into a CSV file and&nbsp; PDF, we
will use <b>sashelp.class</b> and warn when a pupil is less than 13 years
old. To add a deliberate piece of complexity, this will be done in two
stages - once for males and then for females. This is to split the processing
so that warning messages for males are written to the log after processing
has finished for males and warning messages for females are written to
the log after processing has finished for females. In this way we mimic
real life situations where there will be multiple checking categories.
If you have access to sas software then you can run this code yourself
and play around with it.
<p>Here are the requirements:
<p><b>1)</b> The warnings written to the warnings dataset must be exactly
the same as what is written to the log - preferably taken from the same
source.
<br><b>2)</b> The warnings in the log must be written at the point they
were detected and not deferred for later.
<br><b>3)</b> Processing of the warnings should be done in the simplest
way and should avoid macro language and avoid multiple passes of the warnings
dataset if possible.
<br><b>4)</b> A CSV file should be created from the complete warnings dataset
such that, when opened using Excel, it shows the data in columns without
any further formatting.
<br><b>5)</b> A bookmarked PDF should be created with one checking category
per page with the bookmarks clearly labelled and without confusing sub-layers.
The displayed tables should only show the required columns.
<h2>
Creating the empty "warnings" dataset</h2>
When you create a dataset (table) using SQL then it will have zero observations
which is what you want. The table we will create to contain the warnings
is done with the code below (assume you are already in a PROC SQL step).
The last column "holder" is a utility column useful for "proc report" that
I want set to 1 in all cases:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp; *- set up empty warnings dataset -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; CREATE table warnings(label="Class Diagnostics")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
char(40)&nbsp; label='Test type',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
char(8)&nbsp;&nbsp; label='Student Name',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
num(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; label='Age',&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
char(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; label='Gender',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrnmsg&nbsp;&nbsp; char(200)
label='Warning Message',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holder&nbsp;&nbsp; num(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
label='proc report dummy variable'</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
"Inserting" into the warnings dataset</h2>
There are two different ways of inserting into the dataset using SQL. We
can use the "VALUES" method and insert constant text or numbers (we can
not refer to dataset variables but we can resolve macro variables using
this method) or we use the "SELECT" method to select variables by name
plus constants to insert into the table.
<p>You would typically use the "VALUES" method if you were in a macro loop
and resolve macro variables to give you your "constant" text or values.
In this particular case we are trying to minimize macro processing so we
will use the "SELECT" method instead.
<p>Using the "SELECT" method then we would insert into the warnings dataset
as shown below. Note that the list of columns for the warnings dataset
shown after the warnings table is optional but is useful to remind us what
columns need to be inserted into. Values get inserted in the order of the
select. We do not need to specify what selected value goes in what column.
<p><b>I also need to echo the warning to the log</b>. This is the hard
part. Normally I would write a "1" (numeric) to the "holder" field but
I need to echo the warning to the log - and I want to do both these things
in one "select" operation if possible. Fortunately, it is possible. I can
use the "<b>resolve()</b>" function to issue a "<b>%put</b>" to put the
warning message in the log. This will happen in the background and the
resulting value available to "select" is a blank field. I can then test
this field for being a blank in a boolean expression and sas will return
the numeric value "1" (true) which then gets inserted into the holder variable.
I can also use "<b>calculated</b>" to give me access to the generated warning
message variable "msg" instead of having to repeat the code for constructing
the warning message. Look carefully at the "resolve" line in the code below.
The result of that line (space=space = true = 1) gives me the numeric "1"
that gets written to the holder variable.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp; *- insert for MALE pupils &lt; 13 years old and echo in
the log -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; INSERT into warnings(test, name, age, sex, wrnmsg, holder)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select 'Male pupils &lt; 13', name, age, sex,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; 'WARNING: Male pupil '||trim(name)||' age '||strip(put(age,3.))||'
is &lt; 13 years old' as msg,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; resolve('%PUT '||trim(calculated msg)||';')=' '</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; from sashelp.class where sex='M' and age &lt; 13;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Complete code for populating the "warnings" dataset</h2>
Here is the complete code for populating the warnings dataset and writing
warning messages to the log:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>PROC SQL NOPRINT;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- set up empty warnings dataset -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; CREATE table warnings(label="Class Diagnostics")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
char(40)&nbsp; label='Test type',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
char(8)&nbsp;&nbsp; label='Student Name',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
num(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; label='Age',&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
char(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; label='Gender',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrnmsg&nbsp;&nbsp; char(200)
label='Warning Message',</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holder&nbsp;&nbsp; num(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
label='proc report dummy variable'</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- insert for MALE pupils &lt; 13 years old and echo in the
log -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; INSERT into warnings(test, name, age, sex, wrnmsg, holder)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select 'Male pupils &lt; 13', name, age, sex,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; 'WARNING: Male pupil '||trim(name)||' age '||strip(put(age,3.))||'
is &lt; 13 years old' as msg,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; resolve('%PUT '||trim(calculated msg)||';')=' '</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; from sashelp.class where sex='M' and age &lt; 13;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; *- insert for FEMALE pupils &lt; 13 years old and echo in
the log -;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; INSERT into warnings(test, name, age, sex, wrnmsg, holder)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select 'Female pupils &lt; 13', name, age, sex,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; 'WARNING: Female pupil '||trim(name)||' age '||strip(put(age,3.))||'
is &lt; 13 years old' as msg,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; resolve('%PUT '||trim(calculated msg)||';')=' '</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; from sashelp.class where sex='F' and age &lt; 13;</tt>
<p><tt>QUIT;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The CSV file</h2>
The CSV file is simple to produce using "ods csv" and to ensure the data
is in columns when it is opened by Excel we can use a semicolon to separate
fields instead of the default comma. We don't want the "holder" variable
as that it just a utility variable for "proc report" so we will drop it.
The code looks like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let csvdest="\\Client\C$\BISDTM\class.csv";</tt>
<p><tt>*- Create a csv file that can be opened directly -;</tt>
<br><tt>*- using Excel with data aligned in columns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>ods csv file=&amp;csvdest options(delimiter=';');</tt>
<br><tt>proc print label noobs data=warnings(drop=holder);</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br><tt>ods csv close;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The PDF file</h2>
Creating the bookmarked PDF file is much more complicated if we want it
to have a good layout. For more complicated cases you will want to use
"proc report" instead of "proc print" and you have to trick "proc report"
into not generating the "<b>Table1</b>" level in the bookmark. You have
to set "contents" to blank not only at the "proc report" level but inside
it as well using a trick that will be shown below. The trick is to add
a dummy variable and break before it so that the first and all other pages
has the contents set to null. We already have that dummy variable present
in the form of the "holder" variable so no further modification of the
warnings dataset is required.
<p>Note that when using "proc report" to create PDF output you should allow
things such as column widths to default. Also, you do not need to list
the columns you are using - it works like "proc print" in that it prints
the columns in variable position order. What we need to do is print all
the columns that are there, suppressing the "holder" variable and any other
columns we do not want to see using "noprint". We could also drop variable
from the input data as was done for the CSV creation.
<p>Here is how "proc report" will be used to create multiple pages:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let pdfdest="\\Client\C$\BISDTM\class.pdf";</tt>
<p><tt>*- Create a bookmarked PDF where there is a new page&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>*- for each category (Male and Female) and only needed -;</tt>
<br><tt>*- columns are shown (i.e. not the "sex" column).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-;</tt>
<br><tt>ods pdf style=BarrettsBlue file=&amp;pdfdest;</tt>
<p><tt>ods proclabel="Male pupils &lt; 13 y.o.";</tt>
<br><tt>proc report nowd missing contents="" data=warnings(where=(test=:"Male"));</tt>
<br><tt>title1 "Male pupils &lt; 13 y.o.";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define test / noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define sex / noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define holder / noprint order;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; break before holder / page contents='';</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>ods proclabel="Female pupils &lt; 13 y.o.";</tt>
<br><tt>proc report nowd missing contents="" data=warnings(where=(test=:"Female"));</tt>
<br><tt>title1 "Female pupils &lt; 13 y.o.";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define test / noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define sex / noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; define holder / noprint order;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; break before holder / page contents='';</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>ods pdf close;</tt></td>
</tr>
