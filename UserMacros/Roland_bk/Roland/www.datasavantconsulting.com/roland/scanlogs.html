scanlogs</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 27 July 2003]</b>
<p>Scanning SAS logs for important messages is a very neglected thing in
the QC process. Maybe this is because there is not an easy-to-use utility
to do this. Well I have written one and it uses <b>awk</b> which you can
think of as a better version of <b>grep</b> that is also a lot more complicated.

# Script&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : scanlogs

# Purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : To scan SAS logs for important warnings, notes and errors&nbsp;
# SubScripts : none
# Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : This is an important QC tool to ensure your SAS programs have run
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correctly.

done</b></pre>
You should be familiar with everything that precedes the call to <b>awk</b>
if you have studied the previous examples. For a start-off, look at all
the lines that end with a "\". I mentioned before that shell interpreters
expect one statement per line. But when a statement has to go over one
line then you have got to use a continuation character which is the "\"
that I have used. Note that for awk, testing for equality is done with
a double equals symbol. "Or" is a double "|" symbol and "and" is a double
"&amp;" symbol. It is testing for important message lines but ignoring
lines that are not helpful, especially licence expiry warnings. If these
conditions are met the it uses the <b>printf</b> statement to print out
<b>formatted</b>
values. The first 30 spaces it uses for the file name it is working on
and the next 80 spaces it uses for the whole line in the log file. Note
that <b>awk</b> refers to the entire input line as $0. $1 would be the
first field in that line but we don't want to display that. We DO, however,
want to display the file name that is also referred to as $1. To make this
distinction, note the file name is referred to as <b><tt>"'$1'"</tt></b>
to indicate that it is a variable outside awk and not and internal awk
variable.
