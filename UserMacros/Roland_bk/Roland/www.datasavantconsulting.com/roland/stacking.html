<h1>
"stacked" column reports using data _null_</h1></center>
<b>[This site is not connected with the SAS Institute]</b>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
In late 2002 I shifted my focus away from "proc report" back to "data _null_"
reporting in preparation for something that eventually didn't happen. The
reason at the time was that the FDA were insisting that text tables had
to use a 12 point font. Now they say that a 10 point font is OK for tables,
which makes life easier. With a 12 point font I was seeing shell tables
that typically stack age/race/sex/weight underneath each other. If you
do that with "proc report", and there is more than one data line per subject,
then the second data line will follow in the line after the line age/race/sex/weight
has flowed down to. This leaves a gap of three lines (with this example)
between the first and second data line for a subject. This gap looks bad
on a report but the shell tables did not have a gap between the data lines
and so it could not be coded with "proc report" in any normal way. But
everything is possible with "data _null_" so I worked on how best to overcome
this limitation in "proc rep&uuml;ort". What you are seeing on this page
is a reslt of the work I put into getting round this layout problem. It
is mainly historical now.
<h2>
What "proc report" won't do for you</h2>
You could define every field in proc report as "display", then so long
as you had arranged your input dataset to give you what you want then it
would display it for you. But if you expect proc report to do what it normally
does but slightly differently, then you are going to be disappointed. You
might want proc report to flow a string of values into a column for you.
That's no problem. You set the option to "flow" in your column definition,
you define the split character as one of the procedure options and you
have these split characters in all the right places in your input field.
Proc report will flow it for you. But when it flows a column it makes the
whole row "fatter". It will not flow into space that other data lines don't
use. So the following data line will occur <b><i>after</i></b> where the
column has flowed to. If you are flowing four items like age/race/sex/weight
then that will leave a gap of three lines before the next data item is
displayed. It's no good hoping you can set some option so that it will
intelligently use space and avoid leaving gaps. It won't. It never will.
And because you have a four-high stacked identity variable then proc report
wouldn't start that on the last line on a page, would it? That would look
stupid after all. Would it do such a thing? Yes, it will. Proc report cares
nothing about the problems the FDA have visited upon you. It will just
carry on working in the same old way. So if you want your reports to look
"just so" you have a choice between doing massive manipulation of your
dataset going into proc report and just using proc report as a proc print
to display the values - or - you go back to using data _null_ reports.
And what might have taken you five minutes to do on a wide page with proc
report now takes you maybe five hours to code. Maybe much, much longer
because your data _null_ reporting skills have gone rusty. And there are
a lot of young programmers in the industry. Maybe you have never produced
a data _null_ report in your life.
<h2>
The worst reporting scenario</h2>
I am going to show you how to code a data _null_ report covering the worst
scenario I can think of. It will have age/race/sex/weight stacked in a
single column. And since this is an identifying "order" variable then the
whole column will have to be repeated on each new page. And if we are near
the foot of the page then it would be silly to start the group so it will
be put on the following page instead. And on the right of age/race/sex/weight
we will have a long parameter description grouping one of more values.
And this long parameter will sometimes not fit into the column and so it
will have to be "flowed" manually into the line below it. It will be the
worst reporting scenario you are ever likely to be faced with. But seeing
the code and having it as reference should allow you to tackle any report
of any degree of complexity in the future. What I won't cover in this section
is how you get data _null_ reports to interface with #byval and #byvar
entries in the title lines. I have already written this up fully on this
<a href="datanull.html">page</a>.
I want to keep the code free of that so you have more chance of following
it. But if you have never come across a data _null_ report then maybe that
page could act as a gentle introduction to the subject.
<h2>
The code</h2>
This is my latest attempt at the code to do a stacked-column report. Horrible,
isn't it?
