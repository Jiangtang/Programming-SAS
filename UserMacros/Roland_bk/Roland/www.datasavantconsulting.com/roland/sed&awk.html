Using sed &amp; awk &amp; other things</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 29 July 2003]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
If you have carefully read all the Unix tips preceding this and tried out
all the examples then you have already come a long way. You are at the
stage where you can begin to write specialised scripts that run in your
environment. Shortly, you are going to write a simple script called
<b>hdr</b>
that creates a standard header for your SAS program. I expect it is standard
practise to fill in details like the protocol and project id in your header,
your name and the date. Now, of course, I don't know what your standard
header is supposed to look like. I don't know your file structure either
so I don't know how to find your protocol and project id. Well here is
where we learn to pull out pieces of information like that. You have gone
through the crawling stage of Unix scripts and you are about to enter the
walking stage. Learning how to run is another matter, but if you can walk
then you can learn how to run all by yourself. And nobody is pushing you
for time. All the information you need is out there to help you. You have
just got to reach for it and persevere in your learning efforts.
<h2>
Stripping info out of a directory path</h2>
I assume your protocol and study id is contained within your directory
path when you are coding for a study. I am going to tell you how to strip
out that information. You might have to change it to suit your file structure,
however. But you should be able to do that based on the information here.
Also, I am going to be slightly pessimistic. I am going to assume you work
for a multinational and the there is a difference in directory structure
in different locations. But since you are an up-and-coming script writer
then you will not be perturbed by that. If there are differences in directory
structures like that "each side of the pond" then I expect the root of
the directory is defined to a system environment variable at each location.
You will no doubt have a common set of tools at each location and so these
utilities must be aware of this and using a work-around. So suppose this
was a typical directory path in the US:
<p><b><tt>/usr/local/stats/US/data/protocol/study/data/</tt></b>
<p>and in the UK it was:
<p><b><tt>/usr/local/ukstats/data/protocol/study/data</tt></b>
<p>Then if that were the case there is almost certainly a system environmant
variable set up that contains the correct root for your location. Suppose
it were called RD (for root directory) then "echo $RD" at the US end would
result in <b><tt>/usr/local/stats/US/data/</tt></b> and in the UK it would
result in <b><tt>/usr/local/ukstats/data/</tt></b> . Now this is all hypothetical.
The problem is that we need to know where to pick up the protocol and study
from. They are at different positions. But if it were the case then we
could remove that root directory from the path name then they would be
at the same position. The protocol would be in position 1 and the study
in position 2.
<p>You have already used sed to remove .<b>sas</b>, <b>.log</b> and <b>.lst</b>
from file names. We are going to do something similar here. If you remember,
we used a call in the form sed <b><tt>'s/\.sas$//g'</tt></b> to remove
the .sas at the end of program names. But note that the slashes used are
the same as in our file path. Fortunately, sed is not forced to use these
slashes. Whatever is defined as the first separator character will get
used. We will use a percent sign in this case.
<p>We know that pwd will give us the current working directory. So suppose
we were programming in a study and our root directory was defined to the
system environment variable RD (BTW, you can list these environment variable
setting using the <b>env</b> command and pipe it through grep if you like)
then would this get rid of the prefix (bearing in mind that the "^" symbol
is used for matching starts of string)?
<p><b><tt>pwd | sed 's%^$RD%%'</tt></b>
<p>It looks right but it won't work. Let me make you feel at home. You
know that macro variables like &amp;mac do not get resolved if they are
in single quotes? Same thing for Unix variables. They stay as they are
in single quotes but get resolved if they are in double quotes. So the
above won't work but this will work instead:
<p><b><tt>pwd | sed "s%^$RD%%"</tt></b>
<p>Now I don't know what your directory structure looks like but I ran
these commands seperated by semicolons and it worked just fine:
<p><b><tt>RD=/usr/local/ukstats/ ; echo $RD ; echo /usr/local/ukstats/protocol/study/
| sed "s%^$RD%%"</tt></b>
<p>So suppose your directory strusture is just like this hypothetical one
then we could use the do-it-now quotes to assign the protocol like this:
<p><b><tt>protocol=`pwd | sed "s%^$RD%%" | awk -F/ '{print $1}'`</tt></b>
<p>and the study like this:
<p><b><tt>study=`pwd | sed "s%^$RD%%" | awk -F/ '{print $2}'`</tt></b>
<p>How you do it for your site. I don't know, but if your protocol and
study is in your path name then you need to work out the way to get them
out so you can use them.
<h2>
Dates</h2>
If you enter the <b>date</b> command you will see the date and time. There
are almost countless ways of formatting this. I will leave it up to you
to look them up. Try this command:
<p><b><tt>date '+%d-%b-%Y'</tt></b>
<p>Also try changing the %b and %Y entry to different cases. You need to
find out the form of the date you are supposed to use in your program headers.
Once you have got it then you can assign the date to a variable using the
do-it-now quotes like this:
<p><b><tt>date=`date '+%d-%b-%Y'`</tt></b>
<h2>
Person's name</h2>
No need to ask them. Use the <b>getname</b> script for this. With no parameters
supplied then it is the name of the user who invoked it. Again, use do-it-now
quotes.
<p><b><tt>name=`getname`</tt></b>
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have learnt a few things here that you will be able to apply in the
<b>hdr</b> script that you will have to amend extensively to suit your
site standards and directory structure.
