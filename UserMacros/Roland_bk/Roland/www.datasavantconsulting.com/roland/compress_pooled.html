Compressing Pooled Datasets</h1></center>
<b>Updated: 11 May 2014</b>
<p>There is a belief that by storing data as compressed SAS datasets then
you can get shorter elapsed times since the data can be read in quicker.
This is logical. Unfortunately, the SAS language is horrendously inefficient
at reading and writing its own compressed datasets so this is actually
a huge disadvantage in speed. <b>Never use compressed datasets</b>. Don't
store them as compressed. Don't read them in as compressed. The only time
it makes sense to use them is in transferring files across to other systems
but then zipping them will turn them into smaller files than compressed
sas datasets.
