Testing for the existence of a global macro variable</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 03 Sep 2008]</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
In complex sas programs you maybe want to set up and use a macro variable
but you want to be sure it is not already being used as you don't want
to change its contents if that is the case. Note that you will not have
a problem if you are working inside a macro that you wrote and you have
declared your macro variable to be local. Instead, this applies to open
code where a macro variable declaration will be treated as global or where
a macro variable has been declared to be global using the %global statement
within an existing macro.
<h2>
%symexist</h2>
If you are using sas version 9 or later then you can test whether a global
macro variable exists using the <b>%symexist() </b>macro function. It the
macro variable exists then the value of "1" ("True") is returned and if
not "0" ("False") is returned. Note that <b>%symexist works for local macro
variables as well</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let r=rrrrr;
<br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put >> %symexist(r) >>>>;
<br>>> 1 >>>>
<br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put >> %symexist(rnot) >>>>;
<br>>> 0 >>>></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The "declaring it %global" trick</h2>
This is not a recommended solution but you might want to use it if you
are using versions earlier than version 9 sas. I mention this on my <a href="macrotips.html">macro
tips</a> page but I thought I would expand on it here. Let us say you want
to do a bit of processing but it will be different if a global macro variable
has been set. So you want to check on whether it exists or not. If you
try to resolve its value and it has not been set up then you will get an
error message and you want to avoid that. There is a quick and dirty way
to do this and I will tell you about it before going on to more complex
methods. That is - declare the macro variable as global like this - <b>%global
globvar;</b> . Nearly every SAS programmer I know of makes the mistake
in thinking that if you declare a macro variable as global then you will
destroy the contents of that variable. This is not the case. Declaring
a macro variable as global can be done multiple times without any warning
or error message being issued. The contents of that variable are not affected.
So all you have to do is to declare it global and test its contents. If
it has a value then it must have been set up somewhere and so it must exist.
If it has not been set up then it is set up now and its contents will be
null. I used this technique a lot for version 8 sas. It is quick and dirty
but it does the job. But maybe you need a better solution.
<h2>
The %globexist macro</h2>
Using %globexist is another solution and is the one I use. It is a macro
I wrote. Information about what macro variables have been set up can be
found in the <b>sashelp.vmacro</b> view and the <b>dictionary.macros</b>
SQL view so you can use these views to find out if the global macro variable
already exists. There is a <b>"scope"</b> variable which will be set to
<b>"GLOBAL"</b>
for global macro variables (also macro variables set at a high level are
regarded as global) and the name of the variable will be in uppercase and
in the <b>"name"</b> field. Because getting to this information may not
be convenient I wrote a function-style macro to return a list of global
macro variables called
<a href="globlist.sas">globlist</a> and one to check
for the existence of all of one or more global macro variable called <a href="globexist.sas">globexist</a>.
These macros do not contain any procedural or data step boundaries so they
can be used in macro code in the form:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%if %globexist(globvar) %then .....</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>...and I assume the above is the most convenient form for finding out
whether a global macro variable exists. No quick and dirty trick as in
the previous section is used. The macro effectively reads the sashelp.vmacro
view using SCL code called from a macro. Although it is opening, reading
and then closing a SAS view, it is not using a data step to do this nor
a procedural step so it can be used as a function-style macro.
<p>Note the difference between<b> %globexist</b> and <b>%symexist</b>.
%globexist only returns 1 for global macro variables whereas %symexist
does so for local macro variables as well. The difference is illustrated
below.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>224&nbsp; %let mvar1=xxxxxx;</tt>
<br><tt>225</tt>
<br><tt>226&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then symexist for mvar1 = %symexist(mvar1)
>>>>>> ;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>> outside macro then symexist for mvar1 = 1 >>>>>></tt>
<br><tt>227&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then symexist for mvar2 = %symexist(mvar2)

<br><tt>228&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then globexist for mvar1 = %globexist(mvar1)

<br><tt>229&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then globexist for mvar2 = %globexist(mvar2)

<br><tt>>>>> outside macro then globexist for mvar2 = 0 >>>>></tt>
<br><tt>230</tt>
<br><tt>231&nbsp; %macro test;</tt>
<br><tt>232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %let mvar2=yyyyyy;</tt>
<br><tt>233&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put >>>> inside macro then symexist for
mvar1 = %symexist(mvar1) >>>>>> ;</tt>
<br><tt>234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put >>>> inside macro then symexist for
mvar2 = %symexist(mvar2) >>>>>> ;</tt>
<br><tt>235&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put _user_;</tt>
<br><tt>236&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put >>>> inside macro then globexist for

<br><tt>237&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put >>>> inside macro then globexist for
mvar2 = %globexist(mvar2) >>>>> ;</tt>
<br><tt>238&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %symdel mvar2;</tt>
<br><tt>239&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %put _user_;</tt>
<br><tt>240&nbsp; %mend;</tt>
<br><tt>241</tt>
<br><tt>242&nbsp; %test;</tt>

<br><tt>>>>> inside macro then globexist for mvar1 = 1 >>>>></tt>
<br><tt>>>>> inside macro then globexist for mvar2 = 0 >>>>></tt>
<br><tt>WARNING: Attempt to delete macro variable MVAR2 failed. Variable
not found.</tt>
<br><tt>TEST MVAR2 yyyyyy</tt>
<br><tt>GLOBAL _NOMATCH_ MVAR2</tt>
<br><tt>GLOBAL MVAR1 xxxxxx</tt>
<br><tt>243</tt>
<br><tt>244&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then symexist for mvar1 = %symexist(mvar1)

<br><tt>245&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then symexist for mvar2 = %symexist(mvar2)

<br><tt>246&nbsp; %put >>>> outside macro then globexist for mvar1 = %globexist(mvar1)

>>>>> ;</tt>
<br><tt>>>>> outside macro then globexist for mvar2 = 0 >>>>></tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that in the above log output then "GLOBAL _NOMATCH_ MVAR2" does
not mean that MVAR2 is a global macro variable. It means that _NOMATCH_
is a global macro variable and has been assigned the value "MVAR2".
<h2>
%symdel</h2>
At some stage you might want to delete all your global macro variables.
You can do this with the %symdel macro command and if you combine it with
the %globlist macro then it becomes a very simple matter. Look at the log
below.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>1 %let test1=1;</tt>
<br><tt>2 %let test2=2;</tt>
<br><tt>3 %put _global_;</tt>
<br><tt>GLOBAL TEST1 1</tt>
<br><tt>GLOBAL TEST2 2</tt>
<br><tt>4 %symdel %globlist;</tt>
<br><tt>5 %let test3=3;</tt>
<br><tt>6 %put _global_;</tt>
<br><tt>GLOBAL TEST3 3</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You will see in the log that I set up two (effectively) global macro
variables <b>test1</b> and <b>test2</b> and then displayed them using the
<b>%put
_global_</b> command. (Note that if these macro variables exist in open
code then they are treated like global macro variables and recognized by
SAS macro code as such. There is no need to declare them as global). I
then use <b>%symdel %globlist</b> to delete these global macro variables.
Then I create a third global macro variable called <b>test3</b>. So when
I display these global macro variables using the <b>%put _global_</b> statement
you will see that only <b>test3</b> is left.
<p>Note that <b>%symdel</b> only acts on <b>global macro variables</b>
and not local macro variables. You will see a warning in the log in the
previous section where an attempt to use it to delete MVAR2 failed. This
is a bit strange since %symexist also acts on local macro variables and
you might think that %symdel had the same scope as %symexist -- but it
has not. Also you should note that (for some strange reason) if you use
%symdel in the form:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%symdel &amp;var;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>...inside a macro then you might get a syntax error, but it will work
outside a macro in that form without a problem. This is a known bug and
there is a fix for it which you can read about <a href="http://support.sas.com/techsup/unotes/SN/005/005975.html">here</a>.
