<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Spectre is unusual in that the number of Unix shell scripts that go with
the system is very high. Most clinical reporting systems run on a Unix
platform (at date of writing) but have only a fraction of the shell scripts
that Spectre has. The root cause of this was the need for Spectre to produce
bookmarked PDFs. This resulted in many weeks of work being spent to achieve
this and most of this work was spent writing Unix shell scripts of a fairly
complex nature. So the emphasis shifted away from programming using SAS&reg;
software to shell script programming in the early phase of the project.
And once shell script programming became easy and shell scripts fast to
write, it became quicker to write a shell script to do a labour-intensive
repetitive task than do it by hand. And since there are many repetitive
tasks to do in the clinical reporting process, many scripts got written
to do that work. Indeed, two scripts were written ("shdr" and "sohdr")
to make writing scripts faster! You will be introduced to many examples
of these, plus explanations.
<h2>
The Power of Unix</h2>
When I find an opportune moment, I like to explain why the Unix platform
is such a powerful one (actually, <a href="http://dict.die.net/unix/" target="_blank">Unix</a>
is sometimes not "Unix" but "<a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/linuxdef.html" target="_blank">Linux</a>"
instead but it works in the same way so many people still use the "Unix"
label, as I do). <b>The power of Unix comes from the ability of simple
utilities to pass information to each other for processing</b>. When you
first encounter Unix, it is unimaginable how combining simple utilities
can perform complex and useful tasks. When I first started working on Unix
I bought a book about it to learn how to get the most out of Unix. I saw
this point about the utilities emphasized and saw examples of these simple
utilities combined. But they were artificial examples, used for demonstration
purposes, and I could not work out how this would be relevant to me in
the way I would be using Unix for clinical reporting, so I gave up on the
idea at the time. Years later, with clinical reporting producing hundreds
of reports and the repetitive tasks it gave rise to, I started writing
Unix scripts to help me in my work. I also started to combine these utilities
so I could achieve what I was trying to do and <b>then everything started
to fit into place</b>. I understood, at last, what the author of that book
was trying to tell me. And once you have grasped the concept and you have
the skills to combine Unix utilities to achieve what you want, you will
never want to work on a different platform. Once you become fairly expert
with it you will find your work colleagues become aware of it and will
often ask you to write shell scripts or enhance existing ones. A floodgate
of ideas will open and you will be the person asked to turn these ideas
into reality.
<h2>
Scripts vs. Report programs</h2>
If you <b><i>do </i></b>learn to write shell scripts and you are working
in a biostatistics department and your work colleagues ask you to write
scripts for them, then there is a trap you must avoid from the outset.
Because your work colleagues are used to formatted output written to files,
they might expect the same from your shell scripts and they will know that
you have the skills to do it this way. But you must refuse and instead
follow the Unix Principle of Power which is "The power of Unix comes from
the ability of simple utilities to pass information to each other for processing".
These simple utilities expect simple input and they should produce simple
output for the benefit of a utility that might receive that output. So
this output should not be formatted like a report. It should be kept as
simple as possible. Output should be written to "standard output" and not
to a file so that the next utility to read in this information knows where
to find it. So no script you write should write its output to a file. If
output from the scripts needs to be stored, the output can always be "<b><i>redirected</i></b>"
to a file. "Redirection" is a very simple and basic Unix technique. So
writing scripts is nothing like writing report code. You do not format
the output and you do not write to a file. The "customers" you are trying
to please, when writing shell scripts, are not the people where you work.
Your "customers" are other shell scripts, some of which haven't been written
yet, and the way you please these customers is to write to "standard output"
and to keep the formatting as simple as possible. Follow this principle
and you will build powerful and useful applications that will improve the
efficiency of your department. Fail to follow this principle and you will
end up with an unholy mess.
<h2>
The scripts</h2>
The scripts are split into "production scripts" and "utility scripts".
Programmers will be more interested in the utility scripts as these are
the ones that will help speed their work. There is too much to fit on one
