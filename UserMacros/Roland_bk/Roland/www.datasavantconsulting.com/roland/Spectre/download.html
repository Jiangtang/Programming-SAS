<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last updated: 17 Jun 2015</font></b>
<p><font color="#000099"><b>Note:</b> If you arrived at this page directly
using a search engine such as Google then this may not be the <b>"Spectre</b>"
you are looking for. There are a few software packages called <b>"Spectre"</b>.
The "Spectre" you can download below is to do with <b>clinical trials reporting</b>.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
All the macros are free to use</h2>
As of 07 May 2015 then the clinical macros have been donated to the public
domain and are free to use, making <b>all</b> the macros on this web site
free to use. However, <b>none of them are supported</b> unless covered
by a support contract. Without a support contract then no bugs will be
fixed. Reporting of bugs, at present, is pointless as they cannot be acted
upon (because I do not have a personal copy of SAS software to reproduce
these bugs). Any bug reports I receive without a support contract will
be kept but not acted upon or acknowledged. I have limited time to answer
any questions about how to set up and use the macros, though I am happy
to do so if asked. It gives me a chance to improve the documentation, which
always has room for improvement. To commit significant time to supporting
these macros would require a support contract.
<h2>
Why you might want a support contract for the clinical reporting macros</h2>
The clinical reporting macros were designed on the assumption that they
would be used to analyse <b>millions or even<i> hundreds </i>of millions</b>
of observations - so the macros are very quick and efficient and are ideal
for analysing pooled clinical trials. They are possibly as much as 100x
faster at analysing data for pooled studies than your own in-house macros
due to their special design to cope with huge volumes of data. Also, they
have a lot of statistical functionality built into them and they are very
flexible in the way you can display these statistics. This collection of
macros is probably the best candidate for a "standard" clinical reporting
system since they can report both on small scale and very large scale volumes
of data. I am not aware of a more efficient set of macros for analysis
on huge volumes of data. Plus these macros have more statistical functionality
than any other set of macros that I am aware of.
<h2>
How much does a support contract cost?</h2>
I am happy to support these macros for a price that is based on the
<b>individual
SAS renewal licence</b> for a country but I will only support the original
macros as supplied from this web site. I do not do "custom" changes to
the macros for individual clients, as to keep track of individual versions
would be impossible for me due to the complexity of the macros. All the
macros have to remain the same for all users and all those macros will
be webbed here. There are no "different versions" of these macros, although
some new versions might remain experimental for a time. If a client requires
changes or enhancements made to the macros then these changes must be of
such a nature that they can be usefully rolled out to the whole user community.
<p>What follows is the cost for support of the macros (excluding the RGPP
macro) that are based on the individual SAS renewal licence for a country.
It depends on the number of people programming with the macros and in what
country these programmers are operating,. As a guide, the annual renewal
fee for an individual SAS licence in &euro;2000 in Europe and &euro;1100
in China: 50 programmers=3.75 renewals, 100 programmers=5 renewals, 125
programmers=6.25 renewals, 150 programmers=7.5 renewals, 175 programmers=8.75
renewals etc. (applicable sales tax to be added). You may have less than
50 programmers, but for me, supporting any lesser number is the same amount
of work as supporting 50 programmers and so the support contract is the
same. Having said that - you are not obliged to enter a support contract
with me personally. You can do so with anybody offering support for these
macros - but I am not responsible for any negative consequences if you
do and you will get no help from me if this goes wrong.
<h2>
Download</h2>
The <b>clinical reporting system</b> named Spectre can be downloaded as
four zip files. If you are creating an e-book on your PC or laptop then
create a directory "<b>spectre</b>" under your <b>C:</b> drive and create
directories <b>"clinmacros", "utilmacros", "sysmacros"</b> and "<b>scripts</b>"
<b><i>under
</i></b>the
"<b>spectre</b>" directory (you probably don't need the "sysmacros" or
"scripts"). Unzip the files in the relevant directory after you have downloaded
them. Please note that most of the html pages have web counter code embedded
in the html (even if you do not see a counter on the page) and when viewed
on your PC or laptop as an e-book, these pages will attempt to connect
to the Internet. Normally your computer will block this.
<p>Some of the utility macros call macros in the SAS Institute supplied
autocall macros so these must be available on the SASAUTOS path. Put these
SI-supplied macros last on the path (they can be referred to using the
libraef SASAUTOS) with the clinical macros first on the path with the utility
macros following them something like this:
<p><b><tt>options sasautos=("C:\Spectre\clinmacros", "C:\Spectre\utilmacros",
SASAUTOS);</tt></b>
