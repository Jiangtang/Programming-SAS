<h1>
Production Scripts</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The Spectre "production" scripts are those scripts that are involved in
the normal process of running a program suite from producing output through
to creating the PDFs. These are the most complicated scripts. You can view
them from this section. If you are thinking of learning how to write shell
scripts then do not be put off by the complexity of the examples you will
find here. More typical scripts will be those you will find on the "Utility
scripts" page.
<p>To help you understand the purposes of the scripts, they will be split
into sections. That way you will get an idea of <b><i>why</i></b> they
were written and hopefully may give you an idea of when a script might
be useful in a new setting.
<p><i>(When you use your browser to view the scripts, you will probably
see a first line like this "# !/bin/bash #". If you view the same script
as "Source", from the "View" pull-down menu, you will see two lines instead.
The first is "# !/bin/bash" and the second is "#&lt;pre>&lt;b>". I have
inserted this second line so that your browser can correctly display the
script from that point on. The "&lt;pre>" tells the browser that what follows
is "pre-formatted" and the "&lt;b>" tells it to display it as "bold". This
second line will not affect the operation of the script because any line
(except the first) that starts with a "#" is treated as a comment).</i>
<h2>
Titles dataset scripts</h2>
Scripts are used to write titles to a "titles" sas dataset and other scripts
ae used to read them from the "titles" dataset. Actually, there is a "protocol"
dataset that gets written at the same time you create the "titles" dataset
so that will be covered in this section as well. Any script that writes
this dataset or reads it will be using sas to do some of the work. And
because the titles dataset will be placed in a directory that will be decided
by the Spectre administrator it will most likely call a site-specific macro
to do the library allocations. I don't know what your site will call this
allocation macro so I have used the entry "%alloc" in some of these scripts
to refer to this macro that will be used at your site. "%alloc" is not
a real macro. If you have Spectre running at your site then this will have
been changed or removed.
<p>Before you start programming on a study, the Spectre administrator uses
a script to put a template file in the programs directory that they will
copy and amend to become "protocol.txt". A link to it is below.
<br><a href="crprottmpl" target="_blank">crprottmpl</a>
<p>There is another script that will put the template for titles members
in your program directory and name it "titles.template". If you work in
batch then you can use the script "titles" to automatically create your
titles member, but the "titles" script calls the script below in any case.
<br><a href="crtitlestmpl" target="_blank">crtitlestmpl</a>
<p>Once you have finished creating the titles for your program, it must
be read in to create the "titles" dataset. Actually, not just your titles
member gets read in - all titles members get read in and the protocol information
as well and a "protocol" dataset gets created. It is done by the following
script and note that the header lists the scripts it calls as well as the
sas macros.
<br><a href="crtitlesds" target="_blank">crtitlesds</a>
<p>The "crtitlesds" script called the scripts "vtitles", "alltitles", "checktitles"
and "intnop" and these are below.
<br><a href="vtitles" target="_blank">vtitles</a>
<br><a href="alltitles" target="_blank">alltitles</a>
<br><a href="checktitles" target="_blank">checktitles</a>
<br><a href="intnop" target="_blank">intnop</a>
<p>The "intnop" script (short for "in titles no programs") calls the script
"intitlesds" to find out what programs are in the titles dataset as well
as the script "nofile". There is another script similar to "intitlesds"
which finds out all the programs and their report labels. These are below.
<br><a href="nofile" target="_blank">nofile</a>
<br><a href="intitlesds" target="_blank">intitlesds</a>
<br><a href="intitlabels" target="_blank">intitlabels</a>
<h2>
sas batch script</h2>
When you use Spectre you should run all your sas programs in batch using
the "sasb" script. This script will check for errors and warnings and other
important messages and if it finds anything will tell you at the end. If
it finds something then you have to check this. To get more details about
these messages you use the "scanlogs" script.
<br><a href="sasb" target="_blank">sasb</a>
<br><a href="scanlogs" target="_blank">scanlogs</a>
<h2>
printing output</h2>
To print output created using Spectre you should use "lis2ps" which is
short for ".lis to PostScript". This script converts your output file (which
will have the extension ".lis" or ".lis*") to PostScript. It reads information
from the titles dataset and protocol dataset to ensure it applies the correct
margins and font size. You may think you want to print your output, not
convert it to PostScript, but nearly all printers are PostScript printers.
First, your output must be converted to PostScript before it is printed
and "lis2ps" does this. To send it to the printer you use the "-p" option
and specify the printer name after the option. This will be explained in
the header.
<br><a href="lis2ps" target="_blank">lis2ps</a>
<p>"lis2ps" calls other scripts. To see the dependencies, click <a href="../scrdep.html#lis2ps" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
running all the programs</h2>
Certainly, the creation of output will be done using Spectre but the datasets
the reports are produced from may come from elsewhere. If both the reporting
datasets and the report output need to be created and all in one go then
the script "<b>fullrunsuite</b>" is used. Once you launch that script it
is time to go for a coffee and lunch as well. You will get an email from
the script to tell you when it has finished. More likely, you will be running
the reporting program only. The scripts that run the programs are automatically
generated by a script called "<b>makerun</b>". This generates scripts named
"runsuite", "runderived" (for building the datasets) and "runreports" (for
creating the output). You can run "runderived" and "runreports" separately
and you will get an email from each when they have completed. To get the
full list and correct order of the programs to create the reporting datasets,
the script "derorder" is used. These scripts are below.
<br><a href="fullrunsuite" target="_blank">fullrunsuite</a>
<br><a href="makerun" target="_blank">makerun</a>
<br><a href="derorder" target="_blank">derorder</a>
<p>"fullrunsuite" calls other script which in turn call other scripts.
To see the dependencies, click <a href="../scrdep.html#fullrunsuite">here</a>.
<h2>
pagexofy</h2>
When you produce output, your output gets written to a temporary file.
There is another process that needs to be run before you have your final
output and that is adding the "Page X of Y" labels. That is done using
the script "<b>pagexofy</b>" called from the sas macro %closerep. It first
counts the pages so that it knows the "Y" part of "Page X of Y" and then
it reads the temporary file again and adds the page labels. It assumes
a page marker character of "FF"x will be there. If you look at the temporary
file, this "FF"x character appears as a "y" with two dots above it. But
adding page labels is not all it does. If it encounters the non-breaking
space character "A0"x character it will substitute it for a space. For
column alignment purposes using "proc report", it is sometimes necessary
to add such a character to stop the values in columns being shifted when
you use "right" and "center" alignment. But these characters must be removed
at the end and so pagexofy does this. There are some more characters it
will substitute. The titles system changes "&amp;" and "%" to different
characters that pagexofy will change back.
<p><b>Remember this character "A0"x that gets turned into a space</b> by
the macro %closerep calling pagexofy. You will sometimes want to use this
character as well. It is useful for forcing a variable label to be spaces.
If you set a variable label to spaces then sas will use the name of the
variable for the label. But if you set it to this "A0"x character then
sas will accept it and so it will get changed to a space later.
<p>The script is written in "gawk". I found it quite easy to learn gawk
because to me, it is similar to SAS/AF code which I have written in the
past. It can have a "begin" block, a main block and an "end" block and
this is similar to SAS/AF code. The functions are similar to sas as well.
Not only is gawk a much more powerful language for handling text files
but will run much faster than sas, so that is another reason to use it.
You might find the code a little difficult to follow but have a try. See
if you can find the other characters it converts into "&amp;" and "%".

<h2>
creating PDFs</h2>
PDFs are created by converting PostScript files to PDF format using system
utilities. Once you have a PostScript file then the rest is easy. The utility
that converts your output to PostScript is called "<b>lptops</b>" and this
is called from the "lis2ps" script mentioned above. The script "lis2ps"
and the scripts it calls comprise the bulk of the script code written for
Spectre. The process is complicated and some of the scripts are complicated
as well. To create <b><i>bookmarked </i></b>PDFs, the bookmarks have to
be inserted into the postscript file. The bookmarks contain the titles
in your output. It has to get these titles by reading the first ten lines
of your output file. It can not get it from the titles dataset (which would
be more convenient) because only changeable titles are held there. The
reporting macro might add other titles so the only way to be sure you have
all these titles is to read the first ten lines of the output file. The
script that does this is named "getitles". It is written in "gawk" and
has to be tailored for each company using Spectre to ensure it can find
the titles for the different client layout styles. Because this script
may be difficult to understand, a simple sas version of it is supplied
as well, so that the maintenance programmer can gain an understanding of
what the script is trying to do. These are below.
<br><a href="getitles" target="_blank">getitles</a>
<br><a href="getitles_sas" target="_blank">getitles_sas</a>
<p>In case "lptops" makes a mistake when it converts the output to PostScript
there is a utility named "<b>pstolp</b>" that recreates the output from
the PostScript file and compares it to the original. This is a complex
script written in gawk. If a mismatch between the input file and what is
extracted is found then the scripts "badlines" and "badchars" will be called
to tell you exactly where the problem occurred. If needs be, you can then
edit the PostScript file to fix the problem as it will tell you on what
line the problem was found. These scripts are below.
<br><a href="pstolp" target="_blank">pstolp</a>
<br><a href="badlines" target="_blank">badlines</a>
<br><a href="badchars" target="_blank">badchars</a>
<p>Other scripts called by "lis2ps" are below.
<br><a href="getlayout" target="_blank">getlayout</a>
<br><a href="pages" target="_blank">pages</a>
<br><a href="filesize" target="_blank">filesize</a>
<p>When a full run of the reporting programs is done there is a file created
named "donelist.txt" with a list of all the output in it. The number of
pages of each output is shown at the end of each entry. Often there is
too much output to put into a single PDF so "donelist.txt" has to be split
into "donesect(n).txt" files where "n" is a number. The script "bigps"
can be run on "donelist.txt" or individual "donesect(n).txt" files to create
the collected PostScript files. This is below.
<br><a href="bigps" target="_blank">bigps</a>
<p>Once the PostScript file has been generated, it gets converted to PDF
using the script "a4ps2pdf" or "usps2pdf" depending on whether it uses
the A4 layout or the US Letter layout. Your PostScript file is the input
to these utilities and the output is the bookmarked PDF. By default, compression
is used so that the pdf file takes up less room. You can override this
compression using the -u option to give you an uncompressed pdf. When you
ftp the pdf onto a Windows platform, you should choose binary mode for
the default compressed pdf and text mode for the uncompressed pdf. The
-u (uncompressed) function is provided in case the pdf behaves differently
when ftp'ed to Windows so that you can try it in uncompressed mode to see
if it solves the problem. Somebody once noticed that pages got searched
in the correct order but backwards for each page on Windows but got searched
in the correct way using "acroread" on Linux. If you encounter this anomaly
then the -u option will allow you to try it with the uncompressed version.

<br><a href="usps2pdf" target="_blank">usps2pdf</a>
<center><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+2>Finally -- bookmarked PDFs
!!</font></font></center>

<p>We are not done with PDFs quite yet. Once you have the PDF you need
a script to extract a complete list of bookmarks. This list of bookmarks
can then form the basis for a table of contents.
<br><a href="printpdfbookmarks" target="_blank">printpdfbookmarks</a>
<h2>
biglis</h2>
There is a script named "<b>biglis</b>" which works in the same way as
"bigps" except that it creates a listing file with all the output in. This
can then be imported into a text editor such as Word. There is an option
to create a table of contents, using the "toclis" script. If you can write
a clever Word macro to change layout, then there is the option to add orientation
and fontsize information to the list produced.

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have been introduced to all of the production scripts that Spectre
uses. Many of these are complicated due to the complex work they do. They
are not typical of shell scripts that you might write in the future, so
do not be put off by the script code you can link to from this page. If
you are not the Spectre administrator, then you will not use most of these
scripts but the ones you will use in your daily work of running programs
and printing output are "<b>sasb</b>", "<b>sc</b>" and "<b>lis2ps</b>"
so you should remember these. You will be reminded of them on the utility
scripts page.
