<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Sometimes it is a requirement to produce reports for a study that are outside
the study plan. Reports such as these will not form part of a submission
so it is normal to keep these reports separate. There are a number of utilities
to help you do this and you can create bookmarked PDFs from these extra
reports.
<p>If you are doing ad-hoc reporting you will not have any ".titles" members,
therefore you should not run the <b>crtitlesds</b> utility to create a
titles dataset (if you do you will update the titles and protocol datasets
which might not be allowed if a study has been already reported) and you
will not be using the macros %titles, %openrep and %closerep. Instead you
will have to set up all the titles and footnotes in your program code and
you will have to choose your own line size and page size.
<p>This page assumes you are working on a Linux or Unix platform. If you
are working on a non-Unix/Linux platform then you should read the following
page.
<br><a href="winusers.html">%unistats and %npcttab for MS Windows users</a>
<h2>
Options setting</h2>
You should always use the SAS options "<b>noovp nodate nonumber</b>". "nodate
nonumber" is required so that "Page x of Y" labels can be added correctly
and "noovp" will stop the triple display of warnings and errors in the
log.
<h2>
Choosing line size and page size</h2>
You can use the scripts <a href="scripts/a4lsps" target="_blank">a4lsps</a>
and <a href="scripts/uslsps" target="_blank">uslsps</a> to choose a suitable
line size and page size for your report that reflects the paper size (A4
or US Letter) and margins. These scripts default to a 1.0 inch margin except
for the right margin (in the portrait sense) which is 0.75 inches. You
can change these margin defaults if you wish. Whatever margin choices are
made will be displayed. A choice of values for different font sizes will
be displayed. A layout of "L10" means "landscape 10 point" and a layout
of "P8" means "portrait 8 points" etc.. Here is the output from "a4lsps"
using default margins:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>$ a4lsps</tt>
<br><tt>A4 margin settings (inches): -l 1.0 -r 0.75 -t 1.0 -b 1.0</tt>
<br><tt>Layout ls&nbsp; ps</tt>
<br><tt>------ --- --</tt>
<br><tt>L10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 116 42</tt>
<br><tt>L9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 129 47</tt>
<br><tt>L8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 145 53</tt>
<br><tt>P10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78&nbsp; 63</tt>
<br><tt>P9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 87&nbsp; 70</tt>
<br><tt>P8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 98&nbsp; 79</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The margin default "options" were shown in the last example. Here is
another call with the right margin set to 1.0 inch:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>$ a4lsps -r 1.0</tt>
<br><tt>A4 margin settings (inches): -l 1.0 -r 1.0 -t 1.0 -b 1.0</tt>
<br><tt>Layout ls&nbsp; ps</tt>
<br><tt>------ --- --</tt>
<br><tt>L10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 116 41</tt>
<br><tt>L9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 129 45</tt>
<br><tt>L8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 145 51</tt>
<br><tt>P10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 75&nbsp; 63</tt>
<br><tt>P9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 83&nbsp; 70</tt>
<br><tt>P8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 94&nbsp; 79</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The line size and page size values should be supplied to the "ls=" and
"ps=" options in your code.
<h2>
Changing the formchar= option</h2>
If you use the reporting system then the formchar= options is changed by
default inside the %openrep macro so that the spanning line in "proc report"
comes out as underscores and not dashes. Underscores form a solid line
and this is usually preferred so if you want to set the formchar= value
to the same used by %openrep then use the following in your code.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>options formchar='|_---|+|---+=|-/\&lt;>*';</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
The page marker</h2>
If you use the reporting system, it places a page mark on the first line
of each page in the extreme right position. This page marker gets used
for inserting the "Page X of Y" labels. You will probably still want these
page labels so you need to make sure that these page markers get added.
There are two macros you can use for this, <a href="macros/latitle.html" target="_blank">%latitle</a>
and <a href="macros/ctitlepgmrk.html" target="_blank">%ctitlepgmrk</a>.
The first is for left-aligned titles and for the topmost title you can
specify "<b>pagemark=yes</b>" in the macro call. If your topmost title
is centred you can use "%ctitlepgmrk" and the page mark will be added automatically.
<h2>
Left-aligning titles and footnotes</h2>
Macros <a href="utilmacros/latitle.sas" target="_blank">%latitle</a> and
<a href="utilmacros/lafootnote.sas" target="_blank">%lafootnote</a> can
be used for left-aligning titles and footnotes if the "center" option is
in effect.
<h2>
A solid footnote line</h2>
If you are using the reporting system then a solid footnote line is easy
to do in the titles member. You use "&amp;_longline_". But if you are doing
ad-hoc reporting then this is not set up. The easiest way to create a spanning
footnote is to repeat underscores like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>footnote1 "%sysfunc(repeat(_,199))";</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here is an important piece of information - <b>you must have at least
one footnote, even if it is blank</b>. You can specify a blank footnote
using this method.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>footnote1 " ";</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The reason you need one footnote is to make sure the full number of
page lines is used. This is to help a utility create a correct PostScript
file (described later).
<h2>
Keeping reports separate</h2>
If you are producing more than one table then you need to keep the output
separate for each table. This is so page labels can be added correctly
for each table. How you do this is up to you, but a suggested way is to
use a "proc printto" call for each table like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc printto print="myprog.lsta" new;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You could increment the suffix for each table so that you would create
myprog.lsta, myprog.lstb, myprog.lstc etc.. Remember to use the "new" options
otherwise if you rerun your code it will append output to what is already
there.
<h2>
Adding page labels</h2>
You will have to add page labels using the "pagexofy" script. This has
to be done for each output. This is how I suggest you use it - create a
"lis" member out of your "lst" member and give it the same suffix.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>pagexofy myprog.lsta > myprog.lisa</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
"a4ps" and "usps"</h2>
As mentioned in other places on this web site, PDF files are created from
PostScript files. So you have to create a PostScript file before you can
create a PDF. If you were using the reporting system, "lis2ps" would be
used. This extracts information from the titles dataset. But in the case
of ad-hoc reports, your titles will not be in there, so you have to use
"<b>a4ps</b>" or "<b>usps</b>" depending on your paper size ("a4ps" for
A4, "usps" for US Letter). Neither "a4ps" nor "usps" knows what your margins
are. Their default is one inch for all margins except for the right margin
which is 0.75 inches. If you chose different margins when using "a4lsps"
or "uslsps" to give you the line size and page size, you will have to specify
this to the "a4ps" or "usps" utilities. This will be explained in the header
of the script. You can link to a4ps below to read the header if you wish.
<br><a href="scripts/a4ps" target="_blank">a4ps</a>
<p>Both these scripts will handle any mix of layouts in multiple files
so long as you specified the margins correctly. It will probably manage
in any case. It will tell you if it can not. What these scripts need you
to do is to <b>specify all the files in the correct order</b>. They call
other scripts. To see the dependencies, click <a href="scrdep.html#a4ps" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
Ordering the files for "a4ps" and "usps"</h2>
If all your reports came out of one program and you used the method suggested
of having "lst" files with suffixes and this was done in the order you
wanted the output to appear then it is no problem. Assuming you then added
the "Page X of Y" labels using "pagexofy" and used the same suffix then
you would create the PostScript files like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps myprog.lis* > myprog.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But suppose there was a mix of program names? If you knew the order
then you could specify it to "a4ps" like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps file1.lis file2.lis file3.lis file4.lis > myprog.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Using the above method might be difficult if you have a lot of files.
Happily, there are some scripts that might help you. It all depends on
whether "getitles" can extract the titles from your output and identify
the table/appendix reference numbers. It it can, then the script "<b>oplist</b>"
can order the files for you in reference order. You use this command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>oplist myprog1.lis* myprog2.lis*</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you try the command above, specifying your complete list of "lis"
files somehow using wild cards character in the file name if need be, and
if it gives you the correct order then you are in luck. There is another
script like "oplist" called "<b>oporder</b>" that does the same as "oplist"
but just displays the file name. The you can then build your PostScript
file like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps $(oporder myprog1.lis* myprog2.lis*) > myprog.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the above command, what is in "$( )" gets done first (this is called
"substitution"). So the "$(<tt>oporder prog1.lis* myprog2.lis*</tt>)" gets
turned into a list of files in the correct output order which then gets
fed to "a4ps" which then converts them to PostScript in that order.
<p>There is another way of doing this. Suppose all your outputs were listed
in a file, somewhere. Just the file names and nothing else, one per line
and already in the correct order. Then you could use the same "substitution"
technique. If this list were in the file "outlis.txt" then you could use
this command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps $(cat outlis.txt) > myprog.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you had changed the right margin to one inch (instead of the default
0.75 inches) then the command would take the form:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps -r 1.0 $(cat outlis.txt) > myprog.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can see that you have to think about getting the order of your output
right and that there are different ways of doing this.
<h2>
Creating the PDF</h2>
Once you have the PostScript file then the rest is easy. You use the script
"a4ps2pdf" or "usps2pdf" depending on your paper size. The PDF created
will have the same name as your file but with the extension ".pdf". Note
that you will only get correct bookmarks if the "getitles" script (called
from "oporder") was able to extract the titles.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>a4ps2pdf myprog.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how to create bookmarked PDFs when doing ad-hoc reporting.
You can see that it is a lot more difficult than using the reporting system
but there are tools to help you.
