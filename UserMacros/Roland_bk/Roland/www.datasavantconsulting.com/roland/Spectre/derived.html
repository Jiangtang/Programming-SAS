<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The Spectre component for building the derived datasets and "stats" datasets
might not be in use at your site. Either not at all or not for certain
studies. If not at all then you will learn nothing useful here, so it is
recommended that you skip this page and go back to the previous page using
your browser's "Back" button.
<p>Spectre offers very little to help programmers build their derived datasets.
It is quite the opposite, in fact. You have to help the reporting system.
This will be explained later.
<p>The reporting system upon which this one is based, used the "make" utility.
The "make" utility analyses the dependencies between programs and creates
a script to run programs in the correct order. Though an extremely clever
utility, I witnessed much time wasted in editing the scripts it created.
Also, nearly all the programs within a reporting system are there to create
tables and listings, and if this is sensibly done from derived/stats/reporting-ready
datasets then there should no dependencies between these programs. This
only leaves the few programs that create the derived datasets (maybe only
twenty) and there are easier, more visible and more obvious ways of running
these programs in the correct order.
<h2>
Program numbering</h2>
The way the reporting system runs the derived dataset build programs in
the correct order is to trust a numbering system that you are supposed
to use. It runs programs in the order using the number as the first sort
key and the full program name as the second sort key. The number must be
placed directly before the first underscore in the program name. This is
best explained using examples.
<p>The way derived datasets are built, there is usually a cut down version
of an "<b>acct</b>" dataset that the other programs use so this cut down
"acct" dataset has to be the first built. Let us assume that this cut down
"acct" dataset is named "<b>acct0</b>". There may well be other programs
that have to be run before this can be created, so a recommended name for
it would be <b>s10_acct0.sas</b> . The "10" gives it the main order key,
the full name "s10_acct0" is the name order key and will be used as the
second key in the sort. Note the underscore. This is compulsory. You can
have other underscores but the number must be directly before the first
underscore. The actual "name" part of the program, in this case "acct0",
should be the same as the dataset it builds. Finally, the program name,
to qualify, must end with ".sas".
<p>The way the scripts are delivered, it is a requirement that program
names starts with "<b>s</b>" or "<b>d</b>" but the Spectre administrator
is allowed to edit the script to change this to meet your site standards.
Note that you must not leave old versions of programs around that fit this
pattern, otherwise these old versions will be run as well. For example,
suppose you have an old version of the program just mentioned, then do
not call it <b>s10_acct0_old.sas</b> or this too will be run. Call it <b>s10_acct0.old
</b>instead
or use some other way to make sure it does not match the pattern.
<h2>
Numbering order</h2>
The program that creates the cut down "acct" dataset should have the lowest
number. "10" is recommended. Then it is hoped that all the other programs
that build derived dataset can have the number "11". It is recommended
that the number of the program that builds the full "acct" dataset be "20"
so that it should be named <b>s20_acct.sas</b> . Once the full version
"acct" dataset is built there will probably be some efficacy program that
have to be built later that use information in the full "acct" dataset
that could not be put in the cut down "acct0" dataset so these should have
the number "21".
<p>There will often be some dependencies between the derived dataset build
programs. To give an example, it may be a requirement to include the dose
a patient was on for the onset of every AE (Adverse Event). So the "dose"
dataset program has to come before the "adv" (adverse event) dataset program.
So if the dose program is named <b>s11_dose.sas</b> then the adverse event
dataset program should be called <b>s12_adv.sas</b> (assuming the dataset
is named "adv").
<p>From time to time, programs will have to be renamed where more dependencies
are found. This can get out of control, with numbers going higher and higher,
unless two rules are followed. These are:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>No derived dataset is allowed to contain fields that are in the full
"acct" dataset that are not in the cut down "acct0" dataset. This is only
allowed for efficacy datasets.</b></li>

<li>
<b>You should use the lowest number you can, within the constraints of
the numbering system.</b></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The Spectre administrator is also aware of these rules and will make checks
on your program names.
<h2>
derorder</h2>
The script that will be called to identify all the programs to be run and
the order to run them in is called "<b>derorder</b>". You can call this
script to give you this list of programs. It will just display the list
- it will not run any programs. You call it like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>derorder</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can use this script to ensure that all the programs you want to
run will be run and those you do not want to run will be left out. You
will see the order in which your programs will be run.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You will see that the only help the reporting system gives you in the area
of building the derived datasets is the script "derorder" which tells you
all the derived dataset programs that match the pattern it has found and
the order in which they will run. The rest of the work you must do yourself
to ensure the reporting system will run the programs in the correct order.
