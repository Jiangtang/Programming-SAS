<h2>
Introduction</h2>
To my mind, there are <b>two pitfalls</b> waiting for you if you use the
Spectre reporting system. The first pitfall is one I have mentioned in
a few places on this web site, and that is <b>leaving Spectre unvalidated</b>,
as by doing so you will severely limit the speed and efficiency of the
system. The second pitfall, which I have not mentioned elsewhere, is the
quality of the reporting macros that get written for use with Spectre.
If these <b>reporting macros are poorly written</b> then progress with
Spectre will be held back. I do not mean the macros supplied with Spectre
but rather the extra macros that get written to do study reporting or that
report on data types such as lab data. Some of these might call the two
main reporting macros in Spectre - others not. These will hopefully be
generic macros but if you do not have a standard data structure in place
then they will be reporting macros that will get copied from study to study
and amended. The ability to write good SAS macros is a rare skill. If you
are using Spectre then you should select the person who writes the extra
reporting macros with care. You will likely have to hire a specialist to
do this and you should be aware that the rate you will likely have to pay
for their services may be well in excess of what you normally pay for hiring
a study reporting programmer. Maybe as much as 33% more. But if you find
the right person then the extra money you will be paying this person should
be more than compensated for by the higher quality and speed of their work
and the future ease of using and maintaining the reporting macros that
person has written for you.
<h2>
How to choose a macro writer</h2>
Your safest bet for choosing a macro author is to find a specialist who
has written many SAS macros as reflected by the work experience shown on
their CV (Resume). They should have written these macros <b>for the pharmaceutical
industry</b> as the way you write macros varies in different parts of the
industry. Experience counts for everything in this field. Ideally, you
need to see examples of this person's work, but this may not be possible
since the macros will likely be owned by their former clients. You might
be lucky in that somebody at your place of work knows the person and knows
their work and can vouch for them to some degree. Failing that and lacking
actual examples of their work, then you are going to have to find out from
this person their approach to writing macros and the methods they use.
<blockquote>
<h3>
What makes a good macro author?</h3>
There are various views on what makes a good macro author. There are some
"rules of thumb" in use that are misleading as they apply to one industry
and not another. For example, a macro writer who knows that their end user
is a non-programmer will put a lot of checking into the macro parameters
so if something is wrong it will give a meaningful message to the user
because
otherwise the user will have no chance of understanding an error message
in a log. But if the end user of the macro is another SAS programmer then
much less parameter checking might be used. So approaches can differ and
you should be aware of that. But apart from these different approaches,
I would say that there is <b>one thing</b> that distinguishes a good macro
author from a bad one and that is <b>their code is easy to follow even
by junior SAS programmers</b>. There will be a simplicity and clarity that
shines through their code such that even though the macro might be doing
something complicated, the code you look at seems simple and easy to follow.
Of course, in the code they might be calling macros the junior programmer
has not heard of or using techniques the programmer has never seen before,
but still the code will be understandable. So lacking actual examples of
their work that demonstrate this simplicity and clarity then you need to
find out from your prospective macro writer how they think people would
react when reading their code. You want them to say that they think it
would be easy for any other programmer to understand. You have to rely
a little on their honesty for this.
<h3>
SQL or not SQL?</h3>
"SQL or not SQL?" - that is the question! You will know whether yours is
an SQL shop or not. Some pharmaceutical companies and CROs use it extensively
while others do not. Some macro authors will readily put SQL in their code
and some will not. It is not easy for a non SQL programmer&nbsp; to turn
into an SQL programmer and nor is it easy for an SQL programmer to turn
into a data step programmer so <b>choose a person that fits your SQL /
no SQL standards the best</b>. But if it is a non SQL programmer you are
after then the programmer should at least have used SQL as sometimes there
is no alternative to using it (like merging a date with date ranges and
cartesian joins) and a skilled programmer should be aware of this and be
able to reach for SQL as a tool if they need it.</blockquote>

<h2>
Some further Macro Considerations</h2>
If you are writing reporting macros for Spectre then there are some further
considerations. Spectre aims to be a "push button" reporting system. Reporting
macros can be called using the "sascode:" line in the ".titles" member.
There is only one line and this is limited to about 200 characters so there
is not much room for a macro call. This is not a fault in Spectre. It is
a deliberate limitation that is there to force you to <b>write macros in
a way such that most of the parameters will default</b> to useful settings.
The idea is that you set as few parameters as possible and yet get out
a perfectly formatted report. If this can be done well then Spectre has
a chance of becoming a "push button" reporting system. The idea behind
making the transformation over to a "push button" reporting system is that
once you have all your reporting macros in place then the person setting
up the titles and footnotes for a report will also specify which reporting
macro to call and will set a very limited number of parameters and the
report will come out without further programmer intervention. Whoever writes
reporting macros needs to be aware of this.
<blockquote>
<h3>
Know the Spectre reporting macros</h3>
A macro author who is new to Spectre will see typical output from the two
major reporting macros (<b>%npcttab</b> and <b>%unistats</b>) and will
likely jump to conclusions about what the macros can and can not do. But
these macros are more flexible than first meets the eye. It is important
that the macro programmer knows the capabilities of these two macros well.
<h3>
Utility macros</h3>
Avoid "reinventing the wheel" when writing reporting macros and learn to
split tasks into identifiable chunks. This is more easily said than done
and achieving it comes with practise. Many common useful tasks can be put
into macros and<b> they already have been !!</b> Spectre contains a set
of utility macros that you can call that will make writing reporting macros
quicker and easier. And if these are validated macros then validating a
reporting macro that calls them will be easier. So <b>be aware of what
utility macros exist</b> within Spectre. If what you want isn't there then
it should be on my old web site. You should never need to write a utility
macro of a non-statistical nature because there is a 99% chance that it
is already there.
<p>You can see a full list of Spectre macros, including the utility macros,
by clicking on this <a href="maclist2.html" target="_blank">link</a>.
<p>A fuller set of utility macros can be found on my old web site by clicking
<a href="../sasautos.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
Special attention should be paid to the function style macros that are
listed first. Once you get used to using these, you will wonder how you
ever managed without them. They can be used as a sort of meta-code when
writing complex macros once you learn to think with them. An alphabetical
list of macros can be linked to
<a href="../maclist2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h3>
%popfmt</h3>
The importance of the %popfmt macro can not be overstated. Any extra reporting
macro that gets written will probably need to call the %popfmt macro. A
macro author needs to be able to "think" with this macro in the way described
on the page about it. The global macro variables that it sets can be very
useful in allowing macro parameters to default. For example, you should
never have to set column width parameters for treatment arms as what gets
written into one of the global macro parameters is a list of column widths
that you can use as defaults in any new reporting macro. You can link to
a full description macro from the main page or link to it <a href="popfmt.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h3>
Reports fitting the page</h3>
The two main reporting macros in Spectre will default to exactly fitting
the output table to the page width. For an example of the logic look two
thirds the way down the code of <a href="clinmacros/unicatrep.sas" target="_blank">%unicatrep</a>.
The macro programmer should stick to this convention unless it conflicts
with site standards.
<h3>
Other techniques</h3>
The macros that come with Spectre employ techniques that you have maybe
never seen before. You can learn more about this by reading the macro code.
My old web site has a page "Tips on writing SAS macros" that might be of
use. You can link to it <a href="../macrotips.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</blockquote>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
This concludes some thoughts on finding the right programmer to write reporting
macros for you and further considerations on how this task should be approached.
