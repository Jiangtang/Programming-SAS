Use of Temporary Treatment Variables</h1></center>
<b>Last updated: 29 May 2015</b>
<p>You can use the Spectre Clinical macro to reproduce some quite complicated
report layouts where you are showing treatment variables side by side,
maybe from different studies that you are pooling together. The secret
lies in setting up one or more temporary treatment variables (usually numeric),
previously setting up formats to be assigned to each of these temporary
treatment variables that map the numeric value to the lowest level description
of the treatment arm (such as "Placebo", "Drug A", "Drug B") in the orginal
study. You feed this data into the %popfmt macro so that it creates a modified
format for you that adds the population at the end of the labels and creates
the series of variables TRT1, TRT2, TRT3 etc.. Of course, you lose the
top label of these columns that tells you what study or grouping it originally
belonged to, but when you call the Spectre Clinical macros to display the
values then you can restore the labels that identify which study or group
the treatment values belong to using the trtvarlist= parameter in the call
to the macro (see the description of the trtvarlist= parameter in the macro
header).
<p>Another technique you can use when pooling data is when you know you
are showing the same subject data in more than one column. This is easy
to handle. Just repeat your data and in the copies of the data, assign
different treatment values to the temporary treatment variable so that
the data appears in the correct column.
<p>Don't think you are doing something strange in setting up temporary
treatment variables. The Spectre Clinical macros were designed to make
full use of them when pooling studies together in differing combinations.
Temporary treatment variables are your friend!
