<h1>
Installing Spectre (Clinical) on Linux or Unix</h1></center>

<p><br><b><font color="#3333FF">Note: If you arrived at this page directly
using a search engine such as Google then this may not be the "Spectre"
you are looking for. There are a few software packages of this name. This
"Spectre" is to do with clinical trials reporting.</font></b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b>If you just want to use the %npcttab and %unistats macros but do not
want to set up the whole of Spectre (Clinical) then installing it is easy.</b>
All you need to do is download the macros and copy them to a directory
that you then define to sasautos and then everything should work fine.
The rest of the information you can read here is to do with a full Spectre
(Clinical) install for those users planning to set up a full clinical reporting
system. If this does not apply to you then skip the rest of this page.
<p>There are a number of steps to installing Spectre. Some changes to the
shell scripts are needed. Some of the changes are trivial, such as changing
printer names. Other changes require a lot of thought, such as how to allocate
libraries for your sas programs. I will be updating this page as I get
feedback from users who have attempted to do this installation. There will
be things I have missed out and places where I have given unclear instructions
so please send me feedback by email on what is missing or what is wrong
so that I can improve this page. There is a contact link for me at the
bottom of this page.
<p><b>If you are doing this installation yourself</b> and you have never
done an installation like this before then use the following guidelines:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Do not start the installation process until you have all the components
available</b> such as bash, gawk 3.1.4 (or higher), ps2pdf and lptops.</li>

<li>
Read the installation instructions from beginning to end <b>before</b>
you start the installation process to make sure you can do it <b>all</b>.
You may have to arrange for people to help you. <b>Do not start it if you
know you can not finish it the same day</b>.</li>

<li>
Print off this page and work from the hard copy.</li>

<li>
Work through the installation process in the order listed. <b>Do not skip
anything or change the order</b>. Tick off processes when complete and
make notes on your hard copy of any difficulties encountered.</li>

<li>
<b>Never amend anything</b> in Spectre to "get the installation to work"
unless the installation instructions tell you to do so.</li>

<li>
Communicate unclear or missing installation instructions to the author
after you have attempted the installation <b>assuming you carefully followed
the guidelines given above</b> and yet still encountered problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Allocating macros and libraries</h2>
If you are the installer and not a programmer then you should inform the
senior programmer of the existence of the following page and tell them
that they have to take action on it.
<p><a href="alloc.html">Allocation of Libraries for Spectre</a>
<h2>
bash, gawk and ps2pdf</h2>
All the scripts are <b>bash</b> scripts and some of the scripts require
<b>gawk</b>
so you need to make sure that these are available. The <b>ps2pdf</b> utility
is required as well. The <b>gawk</b> version installed should be 3.1.4
or higher.
<h2>
lptops</h2>
Spectre requires "lptops" to convert text output to PostScript. An <b>edit
and recompile</b> of the C code will be required. "<b># define MAXPAGE
1024</b>" needs to be changed to "<b># define MAXPAGE 8192</b>". This is
because the default value of 1024 is too low for clinical reporting. The
latest version of this utility can be found here. The source code is included
in the bundle.
<p><a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/ftp/pub/lptops/" target="_blank">http://www.math.utah.edu/ftp/pub/lptops/</a>
<h2>
acroread</h2>
It is a good idea to have a pdf reader on Unix/Linux so that people can
check the results of conversions to pdf and I recommend "acroread" for
this.
<h2>
Macros and scripts</h2>
Spectre consists of three components; html documentation, macros and shell
script. <b>Only the macros and shell scripts need to be downloaded and
installed on Linux or Unix.</b> The macros and shell scripts must each
have their own library. The shell script library will have to be added
to the PATH system environment variable for users of Spectre at a point
that is fairly early on the path so that Spectre shell scripts take precedence
over possible duplicate shell script names on the system. What you need
are the names of these two directories. The senior programmer will have
to decide the naming of the macro library as it may have to fit in with
their current naming conventions. The name of the shell script library
will probably be less important but the senior programmer will still need
to be consulted on this.
<p>Once you know the names of the two libraries then you are ready to download.
The first download should be to a Windows platform and when done, the macros
and shell scripts should be <b>ftp'd across as text</b> to the Linux/Unix
libraries. Both the <a href="macros.html">macros</a> and <a href="scripts.zip">scripts</a>
come as zip files and the links to download them are highlighted in this
sentence. Some of the files are not wanted and you will be told which ones
to delete after you have ftp'd them all across.
<p>For the macros you should delete any html and text files so delete "<tt>*.<b>html</b></tt>"
and "<b><tt>*.txt</tt></b>".
<p>For the scripts you do not need any of the scripts for Windows nor html
nor text files so delete "<b><tt>*.html</tt></b>", "<b><tt>*.txt</tt></b>"
and "<b><tt>*_win</tt></b>" .
<p>Note that the scripts have to be executable. The following command should
make them so.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>chmod +x *</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Editing some scripts</h2>
The most trivial edits are the printer names. The two printer names in
the supplied scripts are "<b>john</b>" and "<b>mika</b>" (lower case).
At your site I presume you have at least two printers that are named. For
one of these printers replace all instances of "john" and for the other
replace all instances of "mika". This should be done in the script headers
as well. If there are more than two printers available then these will
have to be defined to the scripts in the case/esac blocks. If you see "john"
or "mika" in quotes then this will be part of the option handling routine
in the script (case $OPTARG in) and you must make sure all the available
printers are listed in that case/esac block.
<p>I have a number of scripts that generate program headers. They pick
out the names of the client, office, drug, protocol and increment from
the path name -- but based on <b>my own directory structure</b>. Your directory
structure might be very different. In any case, you might not like my program
headers and so will handle this yourself. But whatever, you will need to
edit the script <a href="scripts/getfields" target="_blank">getfields</a>
to display the client, office, drug, protocol and increment.
<p><b>GS_LIB</b> gets assigned in the two scripts <b>a4ps2pdf</b> and <b>usps2pdf</b>.
GS_LIB tells ghostscript where to find the fonts. You will most likely
need the directories for this. It is possible that at your site there is
no need to assign GS_LIB so these definitions could be removed.
<p><b>AFMPATH</b> gets assigned in the scripts <b>lis2ps</b>, <b>a4ps</b>
and <b>usps</b>. AFMPATH tells the lptops utility where to find the Adobe
font metrics files. This will likely need amending. The scripts as supplied
have a "fromttf" directory defined to AFMPATH. You probably don't have
such a directory and won't need it.
<h2>
Creating @index.txt in the scripts and macros directory</h2>
When you installed the macros and scripts you were asked to delete the
file @index.txt and this was intentional. Now is the time to recreate these
files and test the installation so far. Assuming the script directory is
on your path and the scripts that call SAS software have been correctly
changed then it should be possible to run the script <b>newix</b> in each
of the scripts and macros directly and it should create the file @index.txt
. Please try this. Make the directory the current directory and type in
the command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>newix</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What happened? This is the first hurdle to overcome in the installation
process. The supplied @index.txt for macros looks like <a href="macros/%40index.html">this</a>
and for scripts it looks like <a href="scripts/%40index.html">this</a>. Is
that what you got? Did you get any file created? You might have got a script
error, in which case you can probably fix it. If you got an error within
the SAS software code that caused it to stop then there is no log file.
The reason there is no log file is because it got re-routed to <b>/dev/null</b>
in the <b>crindex</b> script it called. If needs be, do a temporary change
to <b>crindex</b> in the line that invokes SAS software so that instead
of "<b>2>/dev/null</b>" the standard error is routed to a file that you
can look at. A programmer who uses SAS software may need to help you with
this. Once it is working then do not forget to set it back to "2>/dev/null"
if you made this change. When you have got over this hurdle then relax.
Unless you are the senior programmer who uses SAS software, that is, as
they have to jump the second hurdle.
<h2>
Getting "showfmts" and "showfmt" working</h2>
The next hurdle to jump is for the senior programmer whi uses SAS software
who is helping in the installation process. That is getting the scripts
"<b>showfmts</b>" and "<b>showfmt</b>" working. These are the scripts that
display a list of all formats and details of a specific format. Taking
"showfmts" to start with, this will only work if the allocation macro reference
has been changed and the new allocation macro is working (if any), that
the Spectre macros are on the sasautos= path and that the correct formats
are assigned to the fmtsearch= path within the new allocation macro (or
correctly done in the autoexec member if an allocation macro is no longer
required). Please take a look at the script. Note the "-stdio" option used
when SAS software is invoked. This tells the SAS software to use standard
input, standard output and standard error. Standard error has the file
number 2. You will see in that line where SAS software is invoked "2>/dev/null".
/dev/null is the Unix trash can. Anything routed to that trash can will
disappear. Standard error is where the log created by SAS software gets
written to. If you want to see what is in that log then you should route
it to a file such as $HOME/showfmts.log instead. You may have to do this
to see what is going wrong inside your SAS software code but if you do,
do not forget to change it back after you get it working. Assuming you
are in a study data directory then type in the command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>showfmts</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What happened? If you got nothing then re-route the log "2>" to a file
instead of /dev/null and look what is inside it. You may have to add the
"mprint" option to the SAS software code in that script to help work out
what is wrong.
<p>When you get it working then try out the "showfmt" script as well on
one of the formats listed out by the "showfmts" script. Character formats
will need to have the dollar sign preceded by a "\" escape character to
stop Unix assuming it is a Unix variable. Try showfmt on a numeric variable
if need be. Does it work?
<p>This is the second hurdle that the senior programmer who uses SAS software
who is helping in the installation has to jump. Once this is done then
the rest should be easy.
<h2>
Make the two directories read only</h2>
Assuming everything is working so far then it is time to make the members
of the scripts directory and macros directory read only. The following
command should work:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>chmod g-w *</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It would be a good idea if the directory itself had no update access
for the users otherwise one of them might manage to delete one or two of
the members.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
If you have got this far then you should be ready to use Spectre but there
is another script named "<b>getitles</b>" that will require further work.
This is the script that reads the first ten lines of report output to extract
the titles. But that is not part of the installation process. I am sure
I have forgotten something that should be on this page and I am sure you
will hit extra problems, though. You can always email me (contact link
below) and I will try to help, even if you do not have a support contract.
If the latter then I may not be able to give much of my time, it depends
on my priorities, but I will do what I can and am interested in having
feedback from people who have gone through this installation process.
