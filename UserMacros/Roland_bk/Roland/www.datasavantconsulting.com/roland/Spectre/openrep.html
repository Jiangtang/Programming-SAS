<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The macros <b>%openrep</b> and <b>%closerep</b> are used by the reporting
system to route print output to a temporary file (using %openrep) and to
read back the report from the temporary file and add page labels ("Page
X of Y") using %closerep (page labels are not added for figures). These
macros are both Unix and Spectre specific. Every output you create using
Spectre must have %openrep called before the start and %closerep called
at the end. This applies to all tables, listings and figures. These macros
route the output to ".lis" files rather than to ".lst" files for tables
and listings or to a PostScript file for figures. When the final run of
the programs is done, these macros write a list of outputs created to a
file named "<b>donelist.txt</b>" and this file is used as part of the process
to create the final PDFs (writing to "donelist.txt" does not happen when
you run your own programs either individually, using "sasb", or using the
script created with "makemyrun").
<p>These macros call other macros. To see a list of dependencies for these
two macros then click <a href="macdep.html#openrep" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>You <b>should not use</b> these macros if you are not using Spectre
or working on a non-Linux/Unix platform, although you can still use the
Spectre reporting macros. How to do this is explained on the following
pages.

<h2>
Calling the macros in your code</h2>
Normally these macros are called without setting any parameters. What you
have got to keep in mind that you call %openrep before a report starts
and %closerep after you have finished creating your report. If your report
involves making multiple calls to "proc report", you do not call %openrep
and %closerep every time you use "proc report". Instead, you call %openrep
before the first call to "proc report" and %closerep after the last call
to "proc report". Simplified, the code looks like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%openrep</tt>
<p><tt>proc report ......</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc report....</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>%closerep</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The file created by the two macros will have the extension ".lis" followed
by the label defined to the %titles macro. This is covered on the page
that describes the %titles macro which you can link to <a href="titles.html">here</a>.
This label is nearly always blank so the file extension will be just ".lis".
If the label were "a" then the file extension would be ".lisa".
<h2>
%openrep</h2>
The %openrep macro does other things than just open a report, so it does
more than its name suggests. It is bad practise to give a name to a macro
that does not describe its function, so this is a small fault in the system.
It has two system option parameters that have default settings that take
effect when the macro is called and these are shown below.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>/ missing=' '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, set
missing option to a space. If you set this</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to null then no action will be taken.</tt>
<br><tt>/ formchar='|_---|+|---+=|-/\&lt;>*'&nbsp; By default, set formchar
option so that</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
across spanning characters are underscores. If you set this</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to null then no action will be taken.</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It sets the <b>missing </b>character to a space, so that numeric missing
values are shown as spaces in a report rather than periods, and it resets
the <b>formchar</b> so that spanning lines in "proc report" and other report
procedures use an underscore rather than a minus sign. The underscore you
can see as the second character in the formchar list shown above. You have
to be aware of this since sometimes you will not want these options to
take effect. To stop them taking effect you have to set the parameters
to null, as it says above. Suppose you use "proc tabulate" then by default
it draws boxes around your values. If you are not aware of what %openrep
is doing then the spanning character of your boxes will be changed to an
underscore and this will look strange. And you will wonder why it is happening
unless you remember this hidden feature of %openrep.
<p>If you are using SAS&reg; software interactively, %openrep will create
a window and prompt you for the program name. Developing code in batch
is the recommended method, but it still caters for interactive development.
Once you tell it the program name it will remember it during your interactive
session. The reason it must do this is because it is possible to work on
more than one program during an interactive session and it has to be sure
of the one you are intending to work on.
<p>You can view the %openrep macro below.
<br><a href="sysmacros/openrep.sas" target="_blank">%openrep</a>
<h2>
%closerep</h2>
%closerep is simpler because it has no parameters to set. It reads in the
temporary file set up by %openrep and routes the output to the ".lis" file
after calling the "pagexofy" script to add "Page X of Y" labels.
<p>If you are using SAS software interactively, %closerep will open the
final output file in your SAS software session "Notepad" window. It will
still be written to the output file, though. It just displays it for you
in yout Notepad window for your own convenience.
<p>You can view the %closerep macro below.
<br><a href="sysmacros/closerep.sas" target="_blank">%closerep</a>
<h2>
Figure orientation</h2>
For graphics output it would be helpful if you provided some orientation
information so that when people are browsing a PDF then the landscape figures
are offered to them with the correct orientation. It can be very annoying
to have to stop at every landscape figure and change the orientation to
view it and change it back again for the tables and listings. Getting the
orientation right is quite difficult and I learned a trick for doing this.
The trick is to write a hardware character somewhere in the graphics output
using a "note" statement. Nearly all graphics procedures will allow you
to do this. SAS software will not change the hardware character, so long
as it is big enough, and so this single character alerts the PDF browser
to the way you want the output aligned. It will then automatically align
it for you. Here is the note statement I use:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>NOTE move=(98,88) pct font=HWPSL001 height=0.17 in c=white 'Z';</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Do not reduce the height of the character in the note statement or SAS
software will replace it with a drawn character that the PDF browser can
not see. The colour of the character is white so you will not see it in
the final PDF. You can set it to black when testing to see where it is
putting this character and you should do this to <b>be sure it is not overwriting
any existing text or part of the figure</b>. If you use "gv" to view the
postscript file then "gv" will be confused by this character and may not
be able to display the figure but you will always be able to print it using
"<b><tt>lpr -h -P printer-name myfigure.ps</tt></b>".
<h2>
Figure PDF Bookmarks</h2>
When you call the %titles macro, the macro sets up a global macro variable
named <b>_figbkmark_</b> with a pdf bookmark assigned to it based on the
titles in the titles dataset. It echoes this macro variable to the log
(all global macro variables that get set in Spectre macros are written
to the log) so you can see its contents. If the contents are not correct
then you have the option of changing it before you call the %closerep macro
which will then use that global macro variable to create a bookmark for
the PostScript file created. Just set it like you would any other macro
variable in this way:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let _figbkmark_=Whatever pdf bookmark text you want;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This bookmark macro variable has no effect on tables and listings. Their
bookmarks are created by the <b>getitles</b> script at a later stage. The
reason it is done for figures is because a PostScript file is created directly
and all the text in it, including all the titles, gets turned into drawing
instructions (except for the hardware character as described in the previous
section) so it is impossible to extract the titles at a later stage.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have read how you must call %openrep before you create a report and
to call %closerep afterwards and that this is required for tables, listings
and figures.
