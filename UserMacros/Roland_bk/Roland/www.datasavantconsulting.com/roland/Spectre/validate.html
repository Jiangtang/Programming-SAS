<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This is a good place to make suggestions as to how validation programming
will fit in with the reporting system. The use of the reporting macros
%unistats and %npcttab should greatly speed up the production of tables,
once a programmer is used to using them. If no such macros were in place
before, getting the table to "look right" would take up 50% of the programming
time. But with the macros, the reports automatically look right - they
even automatically fit the page. Before such macros, if each output were
independently programmed, then the validation program would take less time
to write than the actual program. With the macros in place, the validation
programs will take <b><i>longer </i></b>to write than the actual programs,
as a proportion of the time. As programmers use the system more, they will
write their own macros (some of which might call %unistats or %npcttab).
If they are well written macros, they will be reusable for other studies.
Once that stage is reached, <b>validation programming will take maybe 75%
of all programming time </b>if the method used stays the same.&nbsp; For
the sake of efficiency, something must be done to avoid this situation
occurring while, at the same time, ensuring that the outputs are correct.
<p>The best approach to avoiding this validation bottleneck is to <b>validate
the main reporting macros</b>. Those macros are %popfmt, %unistats and
%npcttab and their sub macros, especially %unipvals and %npctpvals. Once
you can be sure that these macros are correct, there should be no need
to double program the output. The reporting system will never deliver its
full potential until those macros are validated. Once it is done then validation
programming time will reduce to being less than the time taken to produce
the tables, as it is with most reporting systems, but the nature of the
validation will have shifted in the direction of code checking and checking
macro parameter settings. If reporting is done using macros, eventually
the programmers will forget what code is in the macros and just call them
without much thought. <b>Then the selection of data for the report will
be the new problem area</b>. It was always there as a problem area, but
before it was obscured by the work needed to code the tables and to validate
them. With the coding of tables made efficient, problems associated with
data selection will become obvious and it will be evident that a great
deal of time is being wasted that could easily be avoided. For the sake
of efficiency, this problem has to be addressed as well.
<p>To avoid problems with data selection, the obvious thing to do is to
<b>define
how data is selected for each and every table</b>. This should be done
precisely, using actual variable names and their required settings. The
programmer can then use this data selection definition when coding or calling
macros and the validation programmer can check it is being used correctly.
When you have reached this stage, the reporting system will be working
close to its maximum efficiency. <b>You should be saving at least 75% of
table programming and validation time, compared to a situation where no
standard reporting macros exist</b> (but note that this saving does not
apply to listings).
<p>The transformation will be made from an old situation where producing
study output was a programmer intensive task to a new situation where hardly
any new table programming code gets written and most of the work is done
by the statistician in carefully defining how data is selected for each
table. But there is nothing wrong with that. It should always have been
that way. And it is in this carefully defining the selection of data that
the key lies to creating a totally automated reporting system if this careful
definition of the selection of data can somehow be passed on to the reporting
macro.
<h2>
Validation programs</h2>
If the reporting macros have not been validated and tables are being double
programmed, then it should be obvious that the validation programs should
not use the same reporting macros. Validation programs should have the
same name as the program being validated but should start with the letter
"<b>v</b>". <b>Validation programs do not have titles members and must
not have entries in the titles dataset</b>. Instead, they can use the titles
from the program being validated using the "program=" parameter in the
%titles macro. You can read about using this parameter in the header.
<br><a href="sysmacros/titles.sas" target="_blank">%titles</a>
<p>If you use "lis2ps" to print your validation output then it will use
the settings from the original program by dropping the "v" at the start
of your program name and then looking for a matching layout definition.
This is another reason why your validation program should have the same
name as the program being validated, but with the "v" in front.
<h2>
Scripts that can help you</h2>
There are a number of scripts that can help you if you are using batch.
If your validation program is defined to the exported variable "prog" then
you have scripts to view the <b>o</b>riginal titles, "lis" output and code.
<br><a href="scripts/olis" target="_blank">olis</a>
<br><a href="scripts/otitles" target="_blank">otitles</a>
<br><a href="scripts/opgm" target="_blank">opgm</a>
<h2>
diff, idiff and ddiff</h2>
You are going to have to check the numbers in your validation output against
the numbers in the output you are validating. Maybe you print it out and
then tick the figures you have checked and then hand in your ticked and
signed copy. That is one way of doing it. Another way of doing it is not
only to use the same titles and footnotes as the program being validated
but to copy the layout as well. That way you can <b>compare the output
files</b> against each other using the native "<b>diff</b>" utility or,
better still, the "<b>idiff</b>" utility which allows you to define lines
to ignore in the comparison. You can read about "idiff" below.
<br><a href="scripts/idiff" target="_blank">idiff</a>
<p>"ddiff" is like "idiff" but it works comparing multiple files in two
directories. You can read about it below.
<br><a href="scripts/ddiff" target="_blank">ddiff</a>
<p>To read about the native "diff" utility, use the "man pages" (manual
pages) that are stored on your system using the command "man diff". If
you read those pages you will see the -b option mentioned. If you select
that option it will treat multiple spaces as the same number of spaces.
"idiff" and "ddiff" have this option set. If matching the layout is easy,
then using "idiff" or "ddiff" will give you a fast and complete comparison
which is much better than a time-consuming partial comparison done by hand
where errors might be missed.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
In the "Introduction" you will have read about how the validation process
should shift from double-programming to code checking. This may be a long
way off so you were also given some conventions for naming validation programs,
some scripts that might help you and how comparison of outputs might be
done.
