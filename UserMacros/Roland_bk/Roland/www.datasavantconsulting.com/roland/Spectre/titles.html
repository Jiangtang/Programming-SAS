<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This page will describe the macro that fetches the titles from the titles
dataset and makes them available in your program. It is very simpe to use.
You will mainly use it with a simple call in your code like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>That is all. No semicolon at the end is required (true of nearly all
macros).
<p>Most of this page will be about the global macro variables set up by
the <b>%titles</b> macro and the macros it calls. To see the macro dependency
for the %titles macro then click <a href="macdep.html#titles" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
Global macro variables</h2>
Spectre sets up a large number of global macro variables. They all start
and end with an underscore. It uses these global macro variables to communicate
between macros. You are free to set up your own global macro variables
in your code, but they must not both start and end with an underscore as
these are reserved for Spectre. You might, in an extreme case, need to
change the value of a Spectre global macro variable, but you should never
change its usage. Sometimes you may need to resolve one of these global
macro variables in your code, so it is important to know which ones are
available.
<p>Any time any of the Spectre macros sets up a global macro variable it
will write this information to the log. You can see the list of these and
what the settings are by looking in the log. Here is part of the log from
the program "t_fpatdem". You will see that %titles calls a few macros.
<p>The first set of messages comes from a macro named <b>%jobinfo</b> and
this sets up four global macro variables as you can see.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>MSG: (jobinfo) The following global macro variables have been set
up</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (jobinfo) and can be used in your code.</tt>
<br><tt>_sysin_=/xxxx/xxx/xxx/xxx/xxxxx_xxx/xx_xx_xx/xxx/dev/t_fpatdem.sas</tt>
<br><tt>_prog_=t_fpatdem</tt>
<br><tt>_user_=rrash</tt>
<br><tt>_path_=/xxxx/xxx/xxx/xxx/xxxxx_xxx/xx_xx_xx/xxx/dev</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The second set of messages comes from the macro <b>%protinfo</b>. It
reads in all the protocol information. The Spectre administrator sets up
a file named "protocol.txt" in the programs folder with this information
in. You have already heard about the "titles" dataset. Well, there is a
"protocol" dataset as well. As a programmer, you will probably only be
interested in the _pop(n)_ settings. You will see that only two values
"FAS" and "PPS" are available. If you enter a value in the "pop:" line
in your titles member then it must be one of these or you will get an error
message.
<p>Before we leave this one, have a look at the "_titlestyle_=xy". "xy"
is the client title style. Spectre is designed to work with multiple clients
(companies). Each client will have their own title style so the %titles
macro will call the client titles macro which will be called %xytitles
in this case. This client macro might change the settings of some of the
global macro variables, but it should report on it if it does.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>MSG: (protinfo) The following global macro variables have been
set up</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (protinfo) and can be resolved in your code. This information</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (protinfo) is held in the file "protocol.txt".</tt>
<br><tt>_drugname_=XXXXX</tt>
<br><tt>_protocol_=Protocol No. XX-xxx-xx-xx</tt>

<br><tt>_clean_=clean in (0,1)</tt>
<br><tt>_pop1_=FAS</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel1_=Full Analysis Set</tt>
<br><tt>_pop2_=PPS</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel2_=Per-Protocol Set</tt>
<br><tt>_pop3_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel3_=</tt>
<br><tt>_pop4_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel4_=</tt>
<br><tt>_pop5_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel5_=</tt>
<br><tt>_pop6_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel6_=</tt>
<br><tt>_pop7_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel7_=</tt>
<br><tt>_pop8_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel8_=</tt>
<br><tt>_pop9_=</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel9_=</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The next set of messages comes from the macro <b>%proginfo</b>. Take
a look at the _repsort_ value. It has used the "13.2.1" in the first title
to form a sort key. This sort key will be used to sort the output into
the correct order. I call "13.2.1" a reference number and the same reference
number can not be used twice. You can't have a "Listing 13.2.1" as well
as a "Table 13.2.1". It is not allowed and will result in an error message.
Note that _rotate_ , _device_ , _vsize_ , _hsize_ , _vorigin_ and _horigin_
contain values for figures. The macro %openrep will use these values in
a "goptions" statement if you are creating a figure.&nbsp; The _longline_
setting is useful. You can use this in your titles member. You would typically
use it as the first footnote with the entry "&amp;_longline_". The length
of it will be the same as the linesize of your report (shown assigned to
_ls_) so it will span the full width of the report.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>MSG: (proginfo) The following global macro variables have been
set up and can be</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (proginfo) used in your code. The information is a combination
of what was</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (proginfo) in the .titles file for that program and what is
in "protocol.txt"</tt>
<br><tt>_layout_=L10</tt>
<br><tt>_rotate_=landscape</tt>
<br><tt>_device_=PS300A4</tt>
<br><tt>_vsize_=6.52in</tt>
<br><tt>_hsize_=9.7in</tt>
<br><tt>_vorigin_=0.75in</tt>
<br><tt>_horigin_=1.0in</tt>
<br><tt>_pop_=FAS</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel_=Full Analysis Set</tt>
<br><tt>_reptype_=TABLE</tt>
<br><tt>_repid_=Table 13.2.1</tt>
<br><tt>_replabel_=</tt>
<br><tt>_repsort_=013-002-001-000-000-000</tt>
<br><tt>_ls_=116</tt>
<br><tt>_ps_=42</tt>
<br><tt>_longline_=____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The next set of messages comes from the client titles macro named <b>%xytitles</b>.
In this case it might reset the _repid_ value and the _poplabel_ value
so it reports on this. This client titles macro changes case to capitals
for tables. It does not do this for listings or appendix tables. Like I
wrote above, each client has their own titles style. The global macro variable
_figbkmark_ is set up to contain pdf bookmark text for figures. It is not
used for tables and listings as the bookmark will be found by reading the
first ten lines of each output report.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>MSG: (xytitles) The following global macro variables have been
set</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (xytitles) and can be used in your code.</tt>
<br><tt>_repid_=TABLE 13.2.1</tt>
<br><tt>_poplabel_=FULL ANALYSIS SET</tt>
<br><tt>_tline2_=PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS</tt>
<br><tt>_tline3_=</tt>
<br><tt>_tline4_=</tt>
<br><tt>_figbkmark_=TABLE 13.2.1 PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS FULL ANALYSIS SET</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After the client titles macro has done its work, the %titles macro counts
how many titles and footnotes have been created by calling the <b>%maxtitle</b>
macro. You can see that no footnotes were created but eight title lines
created. Supposing you wanted to add a new title line in your code. You
could do it like this:
<p><tt>title%eval(&amp;_maxtitle_+1) "New title line";</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>MSG: (maxtitle) The following global macro variables have been
set up</tt>
<br><tt>MSG: (maxtitle) and can be used in your code.</tt>
<br><tt>_maxtitle_=8</tt>
<br><tt>_maxfoot_=0</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
%titles with parameters</h2>
Normally you just call the <b>%titles</b> macro with no parameters, but
if you have set up multiple titles in the same titles file and distinguished
them with a label defined to "label:" then to get those titles you have
to specify the label. Suppose the label is "a" then you call the macro
in this way:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%titles(label=a)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you are writing QC programs then you might want to use the titles
of the program you are QCing. Suppose you were QCing the program t_fpatdem
then you can call in its titles like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%titles(program=t_fpatdem)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Invoking the %titles macro gives you the value of the population in
the <b>_pop_</b> global macro variable. You will need to use this to subset
the population. So if you need to call the %titles macro with label=a for
a listing then you would normally do it like this. The two macros %openrep
and %closerep are explained on another page.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><b><tt>%titles</tt></b>
<p><tt>proc sort data=stat.acct(keep=patno &amp;_pop_.cd where=(&amp;_pop_.cd=1))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out=acct(drop=&amp;_pop_.cd);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by patno;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>....other code</tt>
<p><b><tt>%titles(label=a)</tt></b>
<p><tt>%openrep</tt>
<br><tt>....produce the listing</tt>
<br><tt>%closerep</tt>
<p><b><tt>%titles</tt></b>
<p><tt>%openrep</tt>
<br><tt>....produce the table</tt>
<br><tt>%closerep</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The reason it is done like the above, with three calls to the %titles
macro, is because the population is usually only defined for the first
instance of the titles and that is for where the label is blank (for the
table). So you use %titles to give you the populaiton, %titles(label=a)
to give you the titles for the listing and then %titles again to give you
the titles for the table.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how easy it is to include the titles in your code using the
%titles macro. You have also been introduced to the large number of global
macro variables that are created by some of the macros and you have learned
that they are written to the log to inform you that they are available.
