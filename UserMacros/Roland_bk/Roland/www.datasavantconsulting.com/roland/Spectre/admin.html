<h2>
Introduction</h2>
To be a Spectre administrator, you do not need to be a programmer working
with the system, but if you know your Unix commands and understand "piping",
"substitution" and "redirection" up to the level covered in the "Common
Unix Commands" document on this web site which you can link to <a href="unixcom.html">here</a>
then that would be of great help. Being able to maintain simple shell scripts
and write them would be even better as covered in the "Writing bash shell
scripts" document which you can link to <a href="bashscr.html">here</a>.
You will need to be fully familiar with all the scripts that are part of
Spectre, both production scripts and utility scripts, in addition to what
you will find on this page. These can be linked to <a href="scrindex.html">here</a>.
<h2>
lptops</h2>
The reporting system relies on the utility named "<b>lptops</b>" to create
PostScript files from plain text reports and, as the Administrator, you
need to know something about it. The name says what it does - "<b>lp</b>"=line
printer, "<b>to</b>"="to" and "<b>ps</b>"=PostScript (I didn't write it).
It is a C program that your Unix System Administrator can get for you.
Normally it comes compiled but <b>your Unix System Administrator will need
to get the C source code for this</b>. The reason the source code is needed
is because a small change needs to be made to it. In the code it says "#define
MAXPAGE 1024".
<b>This needs to be changed to "#define MAXPAGE 8192"</b>
and the program compiled and stored (there is nothing special about the
number "8192". It is just a multiple of "1024" that I picked). This number
has to be set higher than the maximum number of pages that can be in a
report. Sometimes, lab listings can have thousands of pages and I hope
this number "8192" will be larger. If you do not do this and you have reports
that are more than 1024 pages (the trouble seems to happen if the number
of pages becomes 2000 or larger) then your PostScript file will often become
corrupted. What happens is that for the C language there is no checking
on array bounds so if you write to array number 2000, for example, but
only allowed 1024 entries in the array, then the number will get written
to an area of memory being used for another purpose. Quite likely it will
be where text is being stored so this will end up being written to your
PostScript file. The source code should be available from the following
link and the member name should be "lptops.c" which is the C source code.
<br><a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/ftp/pub/lptops/" target="_blank">http://www.math.utah.edu/ftp/pub/lptops/</a>
<p>There is thorough checking done by the reporting system inside the utility
"lis2ps" so this problem will be spotted and reported if it happens. I
wrote a utility "pstolp" (the opposite of "lptops") that strips out the
text from a PostScript file to turn it back into plain text and then this
file gets compared to the original text file converted by "lptops". It
will report any differences, if it finds any, and will explain the problem.
"pstolp" is written in gawk and it slightly gawk version dependent. This
is explained in the header. You can view this script below.
<br><a href="scripts/pstolp" target="_blank">pstolp</a>
<p>(At the time I developed Spectre, "lptops" was the only utility I could
find that you could specify individual margins for as well as be able to
adjust the spacing between lines. Since then the "<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jonallen/a2pdf-1.11/lib/Script/a2pdf.pm" target="_blank">a2pdf</a>"
utility (not written by me) has these options. By default, Spectre uses
1.1 ratio line spacing instead of the more usual 1.2 because Courier font
characters are not as tall as most other fonts and a line spacing of 1.1
looks better plus it allows more lines to be fitted on a page. "lptops"
works very well and there is every indication that it will continue to
be available, but in case it should ever disappear, I will convert over
to "a2pdf", so do not be concerned on the reliance on "lptops".)
<h2>
crprottmpl</h2>
Before programmers can start work on a study, the "protocol.txt" file needs
to be created and the correct values entered. To create it, first use the
script <a href="scripts/crprottmpl" target="_blank">crprottmpl</a>. This
creates a file named "<b>protocol.template</b>". You have got to copy this
to "<b>protocol.txt</b>" and fill in the values.
<b>You will have to remember
to remove the "Draft" label for the final run.</b>
<h2>
crtitlestmpl</h2>
Use the script <a href="scripts/crtitlestmpl" target="_blank">crtitlestmpl</a>
to create the titles template for the programmers to copy and change into
their titles members. It creates a file named "<b>titles.template</b>".
<h2>
%allocr and %allocw</h2>
Spectre requires two allocation macros -- <b>%allocr</b> and <b>%allocw</b>.
%allocr assigns data libraries and formats in read mode and %allocw does
the same for write mode. <b>Within these macros you must set up a global
macro variable named _ptlibref_ set to the libref of where the "titles"
dataset and "protocol" dataset are located.</b>
<p>The job of writing these macros used to be done by a senior programmer
but since <b>_ptlibref_</b> has been added as a global macro variable then
the <b>Spectre administrator should set up these two macros</b> to make
sure <b>_ptlibref_</b> has not been forgotten. If it isn't set up then
many of the Spectre scripts that call sas will fail. You might have low
level macros to do this or high level macros. I use low level macros for
this such that one has to be written for every study increment. You can
see two examples of them below.
<br><tt><a href="clinmacros/allocr.sas" target="_blank">%allocr</a></tt>
<br><tt><a href="clinmacros/allocw.sas" target="_blank">%allocw</a></tt>
<h2>
Copying to new increments</h2>
If you are setting up a new increment for a study and you want to copy
what is in the old increment into the new one then please be aware that
if you do the copy, even using "cp -p ", that you will become the new owner
of the copies. Programmers will be using the "myfiles" utility to identify
their own files an if the owner gets changed then this will no longer work.
It is better is this copy is done by the Unix administrator so that ownership
details and the dates of the files remain the same. If this is not possible,
then ask the programmers to copy their own files across using "cp -p" (the
"-p" preserves date details) command. They can use the "myfiles" script
to copy only their own files across so this is easy for them. This is the
way they would use it for titles members using the "myfiles" script and
"substitution".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>cp -p $(myfiles *.titles) /old/inc /new/inc</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Program naming conventions</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>
Derived dataset program names</h3>
If the reporting system is being used for the build of the derived datasets
then the numbering convention can go out of control. To recap, the derived
datasets will be built starting with a cut down version of an <b>acct </b>dataset
having one observation per subject. What this is called will vary from
site to site. Suppose this cut down version is named <b>acct0</b> and it
is a stats dataset then the recommendation for the program name is <b>s10_acct0.sas</b>
. The number "10" acts as a sort key that Spectre uses to run the programs
in the specified order. The other derived dataset build programs will use
this acct0 dataset as part of the build process and it is intended that
the stats programs start with <b>s11_</b> and the derived dataset programs
start with <b>d11_</b> . The rest of the name should match the name of
the dataset being built such that the stats adverse events program building
the dataset <b>adv</b> will have the name <b>s11_adv.sas</b> . After the
derived datasets have been built it is normal to create a full <b>acct
</b>dataset.
This will be based on the cut-down <b>acct0</b> dataset but with information
from the other derived dataset added. The recommended name for this is
<b>s20_acct.sas</b>
assuming the final dataset name is
<b>acct</b>. Sometimes the numbering
has to go above "11" if a dataset build program needs the results from
another dataset build program. Suppose the adverse events dataset required
dosing values to be merged in so that you knew what dose a patient was
on when they had an AE. If the dose build program was named s11_dose.sas
then the adverse event build program would have to use a number higher
than "11" such as s12_adv.sas . With programmers working independently,
this numbering of programs can sometimes get out of control. Also, if they
write the specifications for their own datasets, they might decide they
want a field from the final acct dataset included so they will use a number
higher than that used for s20_acct.sas . The situation can get ridiculous
but confusion can be avoided if two rules are followed.
<ul>
<li>
Only <b><i>efficacy </i></b>stats datasets are allowed to contain fields
that are in the "acct" dataset that are not in the "acct0" dataset and
only they can have a number greater than the s20_acct.sas program.</li>

<li>
Programmers must use the lowest number allowed for their derived dataset
build programs.</li>
</ul>
To track this you can use the "<b>derorder</b>" script. This will identify
all those programs that match the pattern for a derived dataset build program.
This is the script that will be called when running these programs to identify
the list of programs to be run and in what order. Just type in the command
from the programs directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>derorder</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Another thing you might notice is that some programmers have old version
of their programs such as <b>d11_adv_old.sas</b> . This is a mistake as
this program matches the pattern and it too will be run. Old versions should
have names like <b>d11_adv.old</b> so that they do not match the pattern.
<h3>
Report program names</h3>
Programmers using the reporting system tend to work at a fast pace. Once
they have a reporting program they will often makes copies of it to use
for different populations (like "safety", "full analysis set" and "per-protocol")
and different age groups. If their naming convention is wrong for the first
program then this error will get propagated to the copies. If they can
spot this early then some time will be saved. The mistake will be easiest
seen in their titles members. You can use the "myfiles" command for a specific
user so to list the titles members to "rrash" you could use this command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>myfiles -u rrash *.titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It would be a good idea to check on this from time to time and inform
the programmers if their file names should be changed. It should not be
a lot of work for them as they can use "<b>grename</b>" to rename their
files, "<b>mybadtitlesprogs</b>" to then list where the program name is
different to the titles member file name (using the "-f" option will fix
it for them) and if their headers follow the recommended convention then
"<b>mybadprognames</b>" can both identify and fix where the program name
does not match the file name.</blockquote>

<h2>
Running programs</h2>
You will be the person asked to run a suite (suite=entire collection) of
programs. To remind you again, you will need to change the information
in "protocol.txt" for the final run so that the reports do not say "Draft
Version" for this.
<p>If the reporting system is being used to create the derived datasets
and you want to run all these programs plus the reporting programs then
you can do this using the command <a href="scripts/fullrunsuite" target="_blank">fullrunsuite</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>fullrunsuite</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you only want to run the derived dataset build programs or the report
programs then first you have to generate the scripts to do this using the
command <a href="scripts/makerun" target="_blank">makerun</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>makerun</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Then you can run whatever set of programs you wish to run using the
generated scripts "runderived" or "runreports". Whichever you choose to
run, you should redirect standard error to a file. To run the derived dataset
programs use this command from the programs directory:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>./runderived 2>runderived.err</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To run the reports, use this command from the programs directory:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>./runreports 2>runreports.err</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You should check the "err" files at the end for errors. If you want
to see only those programs that encountered some sort of problem then use
the script "<a href="scripts/runproblems" target="_blank">runproblems</a>"
to display these. Note that <b>when an error is encountered for the derived
dataset build, the programs following it are aborted</b>. This is not the
case for the report programs as they have no dependency on each other.
<h2>
Splitting "donelist.txt" into sections</h2>
When the "runreports" script runs, each new output created gets added to
the file "donelist.txt". At the end of the script the list of outputs is
sorted in reference number order and the number of pages for each report
is added at the end of each line. This file can be used as input to build
a single large PostScript file using the <a href="scripts/bigps" target="_blank">bigps</a>
script. Most often, the PostScript file would be too large so "donelist.txt"
will have to be split into sections. "bigps" can work on these donelist
section files as well using the "-n" option and supplying the section number.
These donelist section files must follow the naming convention "<b>donesect1.txt</b>",
"<b>donesect2.txt</b>" etc. The have to be created by hand by copying and
pasting sections of "donelist.txt". How you do is up to you, but a rough
guide is that each section should not contain more than 2500 pages. The
pages are shown at the end of each line in donelist.txt to help you make
this split. Some files, such as lab tables, will be 2000 pages or more
so they should have their own donesect file.
<p>Once you have made your donesect files, these have to be checked again
the original donelist.txt file to make sure you included all the entries
and have not repeated any. You do this using the script <a href="scripts/donesectchk" target="_blank">donesectchk</a>.
It will tell you if it detects any problems.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>donesectchk</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
bigps</h2>
"<a href="scripts/bigps" target="_blank">bigps</a>" is the script you use
to create the collected PostScript file, either from the full donelist.txt
file or the donesect files. For the donesect files you have to use the
"-n" option. There are other options as well. You can specify a file pattern
if you want to, but it is better to take the time to create donesect files.
<p>Here is how you would use this script to create PostScript files and
PDFs for two donesect files. "<a href="scripts/a4ps2pdf" target="_blank">a4ps2pdf</a>"
is used to create the PDF files. If your paper size was US Letter then
"<a href="scripts/usps2pdf" target="_blank">usps2pdf</a>" would be used
instead.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>bigps -n 1 > BIG1.ps</tt>
<br><tt>a4ps2pdf BIG1.ps</tt>
<br><tt>bigps -n 2 > BIG2.ps</tt>
<br><tt>a4ps2pdf BIG2.ps</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When "a4ps2pdf" (or "usps2pdf") creates a PDF file it gives it the name
name as the original file but with the file extension ".pdf" so the two
PDFs created in the above case would be "BIG1.pdf" and "BIG2.pdf".
<h2>
printpdfbookmarks</h2>
When the PDF files have been produced you may be asked to provide a list
of bookmarks in each one. You do this using the <a href="scripts/printpdfbookmarks" target="_blank">printpdfbookmarks</a>
script. To keep the output, redirect to a file.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>printpdfbookmarks BIG1.pdf > bookmarks1.txt</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
titlesvsbkmarks</h2>
The script "<a href="scripts/titlesvsbkmarks" target="_blank">titlesvsbkmarks</a>"
will extract the table/appendix reference number from the first title of
all the titles stored in ALL.TITLES and compare these with what is in the
bookmarks of the PDF files you specify and will list out the references
in ALL.TITLES that it can not find in the PDF bookmarks. You can use this
to make sure nothing is missing in the PDFs.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>titlesvsbkmarks BIG*.pdf</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
biglis</h2>
Sometimes, instead of a PDF, a collected listing is required. This might
be for a Word document. The script "<a href="scripts/biglis" target="_blank">biglis</a>"
is used for this. It accepts similar options to "bigps" and it can optionally
create a table of contents.
<h2>
"ddiff" and report run backups</h2>
After a set of reports has been produced it is a good idea to make a backup
of this in a sub folder. There is a script named "<b>ddiff</b>" you can
use to compare the contents of one directory with another and you can use
this to see if any numbers have changed in the reports since the previous
run. To back up all new output to a status directory you need to know what
files to copy. It might not be sufficient to use <b>t*.lis</b> as a file
pattern as this pattern might pick up some files that were not created
when the suite of programs was run. You should use the script "<b>donefiles</b>"
to give you a list of output. You will be shown how to use this. It reads
"<b>donelist.txt</b>" and <b>you will need to make a backup copy of this
file</b> as well, as the script "<b>bigps</b>" (and "biglis") needs it.
Another file you should back up is the standard error file from the "runreports"
run. Hopefully, you redirected this to a file. Maybe you named it "runreports.err".
Suppose you ran these programs on 17 Feb 2006 then you&nbsp; might create
a backup folder and copy the files to it like this (note the use of the
"-p" option to ensure the file date stamps do not change):
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>mkdir status060217</tt>
<br><tt>cp -p $(donefiles) status060217</tt>
<br><tt>cp -p donelist.txt status060217</tt>
<br><tt>cp -p runreports.err status060217</tt>
<br><tt>cp -p runreports.chk status060217</tt>
<br><tt>cp -p ALL.TITLES status060217</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now that you have the backup, it is important to know if any of the
numbers in the reports have changed since the previous run. You should
use the script "ddiff" for this. It compares the contents of every file
(that matches a pattern you supply) <b>in the current directory</b> to
identically named files in another directory. Since there might be a date
(and time) change in one line of every output you can specify this to the
"-i" (ignore) option so that these lines are not compared. Suppose this
line with the changing date (and time) started with the word "Report" and
suppose the previous run was on the 05 Feb 2006 then you could make a comparison
and store the results like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>ddiff -i ^Report -d ../status060205 *.lis* > ddiff_060217_vs_060205.txt</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Using the "ddiff" script should become part of your QC process</b>.
You should think about including its use in your SOPs. As an administrator,
you will need to run "ddiff" in this way and be aware of any number differences
found in any of the output. Someone will need to know about these differences
if it involves numbers changing. You can learn more about "ddiff" from
its header.
<br><a href="scripts/ddiff" target="_blank">ddiff</a>
<h2>
PDFs for ad-hoc reports and legacy systems</h2>
For ad-hoc reporting and legacy systems it may be desirable to create bookmarked
PDFs so you might be asked to do this. How you do this in these two cases
is covered on other pages which you can link to below.
<p><a href="adhoc.html">Ad-hoc Reporting and PDFs</a>
<p><a href="legacy.html">Legacy Systems and PDFs</a>
<h2>
Adding a pdf bookmark to a PostScript file</h2>
It is possible to edit a postscript file to add a pdf bookmark so that
when it gets converted to a pdf, the bookmark will be there. You might
have to do this manually one day, so I will explain how I am doing it in
Spectre. I don't know the best way to do this, I just know one way that
works. The clearest way to explain it is to get you to look at the macro
%closerep in the end section where it deals with figures. You can view
this macro using the link below. Look for the data _null_ step near the
end.
<br><a href="sysmacros/closerep.sas" target="_blank">%closerep</a>
<p>You will see some of the code below used in the data _null_ step. It
is writing out lines of postscript code. Don't ask me to explain how postscript
code works, because I do not have a clue, but what the following code does
is add four lines after the first line in the postscript file. The first
two lines act as a warning to a postscript reader to ignore the instruction
"pdfmark". Most printers are postscript readers so this tells the printer
not to do anything if it encounters the "pdfmark" instruction (like print
it out). The last two lines add the bookmark. The text of the bookmark
should be in round brackets and should <b>not be in quotes</b>. &amp;_figbkmark_
gets resolved into the bookmark text in this case. If you edit a postscript
file to add these lines then do not put the lines in double quotes as in
the code below. These quotes are there to get the program syntax correct.
And if you edit a file then copy and paste what you see below within the
double quotes. Do not think in code terms and try to combine two lines
into one. Just copy it exactly as it is. Note that two sets of brackets
are curly brackets but round brackets are used to contain the bookmark
text. If you want to check that you have done it correctly then open up
the postscript file in "gv" after you have edited it. It will soon tell
you if there is a problem, though you may not understand its explanation.
If all is well then the bookmark should be there when you convert the postscript
file to a pdf.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %if %length(&amp;_figbkmark_) %then %do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if _n_=1 then do;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put _infile_;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put "/pdfmark where";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put "{pop} {userdict
/pdfmark /cleartomark load put} ifelse";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put "[ /Title (&amp;_figbkmark_)";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put "&nbsp; /OUT pdfmark";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else put _infile_;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %end;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
This concludes the guide to Spectre administration. Hopefully, you can
see that this work is easy and it won't take up a lot of your time. On
the negative side, it might mean that you will be given a lot of programming
to do in addition to your Administrator duties.
