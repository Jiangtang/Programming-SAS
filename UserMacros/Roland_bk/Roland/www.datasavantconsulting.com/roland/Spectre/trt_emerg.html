<h1>
Reporting Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</h1></center>
<b>Last updated: 30 May 2015</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Both macros %npcttab and %aetab can be used to report counts and percentages
of adverse events but you need a very clear idea of what is happening inside
these macros. To explain what they are doing in simple terms is to state
that they are producing counts and percentages of <b>whatever they find
in the input data</b>. There is no clever logic inside that "collapses"
adverse event multiple records or works out what adverse events happened
on treatment and only reports those. It does nothing like that. It produces
counts and percentages of whatever it finds in the input data. So if you
have adverse event data and you want %npcttab or %aetab to only give you
counts and percentages of treatment-emergent adverse events then it is
up to you to make sure that the input dataset for the macros only contains
what you define as treatment-emergent adverse events. These are general-purpose
counts and percentages macros that know nothing about your adverse event
data and what fields mean what. You have to know what your own data means
and only pass to these macros the final data you want to see counts and
percentages for. You have to do that work yourself.
<h2>
Problems in defining "Treatment-Emergent"</h2>
Now it has been clarified that %npcttab and %aetab give counts and percentages
of whatever exists in the input dataset, irrespective of any identifying
information which says whether the records should be used or not, then
it is you the programmer who has to be careful to only pass to the macros
the adverse events to be counted and reported. You maybe need an in-house
written macro or piece of code to select only treatment-emergent adverse
events. The Spectre macros cannot do that for you. So the rest of this
page is to get you t think, in the case of treatment-emergent adverse events,
what defines these. And the definition of this will vary from site to site.
<h2>
Pre-Treatment "Treatment-Emergent"</h2>
This is the first piece of controversy I am giving you to think about.
And that is, if an adverse event that occurred before the first dose was
taken was caused by the drug. Logically you would think not. But in some
circumstances it might be. Here is a description of a scenario. A subject
comes in for a visit to be given a new set of drugs, this time not a placebo
run-in, to be taken the following morning. The doctor dispensing the drugs
is not the same person who records the subject adverse events and so the
way the trial is designed, there is no collection of adverse events done
on that day and recorded on a specific CRF page that would indicate that
the adverse events must have been pre-treatment. Besides, they are not
supposed to take the "real" drugs until the next morning and a pre-treatment
adverse event might happen later in the day. So what defines a treatment-emergent
adverse event will be any adverse event starting the following day when
the subject takes the drug.
<p>Everything looks simple so far.
<p>But then things go wrong. Many subjects will be fully aware that a drug
has a placebo run-in period. They have maybe read about it on the Internet
and their reading about it on the Internet is maybe why they signed up
for the trial in the first place. So the subject knows that at last they
have the drug. And as soon as they get home they take the first pill, even
though they have been told to take the first pill the following morning.
After taking the pill they immediately get an adverse event such as nausea,
headache or a metallic taste in the mouth (very common for anti-depressants)
and they note down the date and when it happened. So when it comes for
the visit where they tell the person about their adverse events then they
report this, but don't say they took the drug a day early and the adverse
events happened after they had taken the drug. So from the date of the
adverse event and the expected date of the first dose, these adverse events
will be recorded as pre-treatment adverse events. They may get exactly
the same adverse events for the first two weeks, but when it comes to reporting
treatment-emergent adverse events then so long as the intensity and severity
has not increased, these might not be regarded as treatment-emergent, because
they already happened before the drug was taken.
<p>I hope you can understand the problem. What should have happened to
avoid this situation is to assume that the date of start of treatment was
the date the drugs were <b>DISPENSED</b> to the subject and not the planned
date of first dose. And if adverse events were recorded at the visit the
drug was dispensed then it would be clear that all those adverse events
were definitely pre-treatment. It is all a matter of trial design.
<h2>
Post-Treatment "Treatment-Emergent"</h2>
Drugs are toxic and have to be broken down by the liver and turned into
different substances that are safe for the body to flush out of their system.
Different people have different liver functions so for some people, their
liver might change the drug into something more toxic that the original
drug. So let's say a clinical trial ended and then a month after the trial
ended a subject's fingernails start dropping out. This, for sure, is in
the post-treatment period so how can it be treatment-emergent? In the case
of fingernails dropping out or anything unusual then it is safer to assume
that it is drug related. It could even be an adverse event like falling
own some stairs. maybe the drug had a long-term effect on the balance of
the subject. So some adverse events happening post treatment may be drug
related and others not. And the possibly drug related ones have to be reported
as such and are really therefore treatment-emergent.
<p>The way this is usually handled in clinical trials is to have two different
study end dates used for classifying adverse events into periods. For serious
adverse events, a later date is used for trial end and therefore the definition
of on-treatment.
<h2>
Drug-related "Treatment-Emergent"</h2>
The trial investigator usually has the option of deciding and recording
an adverse event as being drug-related and if they have done this then
it is normal to classify this adverse event as treatment-emergent no matter
what the onset date was.
<h2>
Mistakes in "Collapsing" Adverse Events</h2>
I have seen a few white papers on the Internet about how to "collapse"
adverse events. This is where you have multiple adverse event records that
relate to the same adverse event. For example, if you have a single adverse
event recorded twice for two contiguous periods, and the intensity is greater
for the second period, then this adverse event will be "collapsed" into
a single adverse event for the combined period using the higher intensity.
Unfortunately, this will be the wrong thing to do unless the (true) treatment
start data is taken into account. If the second period happened after treatment
start then with its higher intensity it should be treated as a new adverse
event that is treatment-emergent. "Collapsing" adverse event records only
makes sense if they all happened in the same trial period. Indiscriminate
"collapsing" of adverse events should be avoided.
<p>It is worth mentioning at this point that you should only "collapse"
data if you really need to. If there are multiple records for the same
adverse events for the same subjects then the count that %npcttab and %aetab
gives you is the unique subject count, so if a subject has multiple records
for the same adverse event then they will only be counted once. It is only
important to "collapse" adverse events where the number of "events" is
additionally requested, and this is rarely requested.
<p>Finally, for this section, I will describe another difficult scenario.
Suppose you have an adverse event for a subject that has five periods and
all five periods are contiguous as follows. <b>01Jan2010-20Jan2010 Grade
1, 21Jan2010-18Jan2010 Grade 2, 19Jan2010-10Feb2010 Grade 1, 11Feb2010-24Feb2010
Grade 2, 25Feb2010-08Mar2010 Grade 1</b>. Treatment start date was 05Jan2010
which was during the first period as a Grade 1 adverse event. How should
this be treated when it comes to collapsing and is it right to collapse
into a single adverse event in this case? You can see that if we collapse
all five periods and assign the worst grade for this period then we have
a Grade 2 event starting 01Jan2010 and ending 08Mar2010. Using this collapsed
single event implies the adverse event was not treatment-emergent since
it existed as a Grade 2 adverse event pre-treatment. But this is not correct
because the adverse event worsened to a Grade 2 on-treatment. Because of
this, we will ignore the Grade 1 periods on treatment such that it only
becomes an adverse event for Grade 2 or above. So we have a choice: do
we have a Grade 2 adverse event that is treatment-emergent starting on
the treatment start date of 05Jan2010 and ending 08Mar2010? Or do we wait
until the start of the first Grade 2 period such that we have a Grade 2
adverse event starting 21Jan2010 and ending 08Mar2010? Or should we skip
the fifth period altogether, since this was only a Grade 1 and was present
pre-treatment, such that the two previous scenarios had an end date of
24Feb2010? A further difficulty comes with the counts of treatment emergent
adverse events. What is the worst case, since in doubt, we report the worst
case? Is two adverse events at Grade 2 worse than just the one collapsed
adverse event at Grade 2? In which case we should not collapse into one.
Or is the longer period at Grade 2 that spans the 19Jan2010-10Feb2010 Grade
1 period the worst case? You could make a convincing argument for either
for this situation! This illustrates the dangers of collapsing adverse
events where the adverse event was present pre-treatment at the same Grade
as on-treatment for the periods you are trying to collapse.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
As was explained at the start of this page, the way %npcttab and %aetab
work is that they assume that they need to report on all the data in the
input dataset. They do not select on this data in any way. So it was explained
to you, for the case of treatment-emergent adverse events, how you might
define which adverse event belong to the treatment-emergent category so
that only relevant data is passed to %npcttab or %aetab as input data to
produce a report on.
