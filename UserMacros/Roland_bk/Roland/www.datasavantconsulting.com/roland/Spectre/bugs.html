<p>SPECTRE ON WINDOWS: 25Feb07: Initial release. Uses Cygwin. PDF creation
and emailing from Spectre scripts not done yet.&nbsp;
<p>makerun: 25Feb07: generation of "runreports" script changed to use "rm"
for deleting report program output instead of the safer "rem" to look for
group permission before deletion.&nbsp;
<p>%proginfo: 21Feb07: made Windows compliant&nbsp;
<p>%layout2lsps: 21Feb07: new macro added for Windows compliancy
<p>dirtree: 18Feb07: new script to display directory structure with indents
from current directory downwards
<p>sasb: 17Feb07: Made Windows compliant and now calls "scanlogs" instead
of "sc" due to Cygwin command conflict&nbsp;
<p>sc: 17Feb07: "sc" has been renamed to "scanlogs" due to Cygwin command
conflict&nbsp;
<p>%openrep: 16Feb07: Made Windows compliant&nbsp;
<p>%closerep: 16Feb07: Now writes to "donelist.tmp" rather than "donelist.txt".
Made Windows compliant&nbsp;
<p>makerun: 16Feb07: "donelist.tmp" processing added and updated for "donepages"
script&nbsp;
<p>donepages: 16Feb07: Changed to take a donelist file as the first parameter
<p>%jobinfo: 13Feb2007: Made Windows compliant.&nbsp;
<p>All Macros: 13Feb2007: "MACRO CALLED" messages added before macro definition
for all sas macros to put name of macro called and the version of the macro
in the sas log.&nbsp;
<p>SPECTRE ON WINDOWS: 05Feb07: Start of project to port Spectre onto Windows
Phase I (uses Cygwin Linux emulator).&nbsp;
<p>ddiff: 24Nov2006: A check was added to make sure a file of the same
name exists in the target directory and no comparison will be done unless
that is the case. Fixed on 24Nov2006.&nbsp;
<p>ddiff: 13Nov2006: File permissions can prevent temporary files from
being overwritten so these are now deleted at end of every iteration. Fixed
on 13Nov2006&nbsp;
<p>%unistats: 09Oct2006: Problem detected with fmtord. not found messages.
Fixed on 09Oct2006&nbsp;
<p>%unipvals and %unistats: Sometimes a p-value can not be calculated due
to unusual circumstances and to avoid macro crashes if these datasets are
not found then %unipvals now sets up dummy p-value datasets. %unistats
has a pvalmisstxt=" n/a" added so that missing p-values from the dummy
datasets can be given a suitable text form. Updated 23Sep06&nbsp;
<p>%unistats: 26Aug2006: nopctcatlist= parameter added. Version incremented
from 3.0 to 3.1
<p>%unistats: 21July2006: bug associated with lowercasing _statlabel when
set to &amp;misstxt. Fixed on 22Jul06
<p>%unistats: 11July2006: _statord=1 instead of _statord=5 used to match
p-value to category. Search for "RRB002" in the code to see where change
was made. Fixed on 11Jul06&nbsp;
<p>%unipvals: 10Jul06: "missing" option added to "proc freq" tables statements
so it could calculate p-values based on missing values passed to it by
the %unistats macro.&nbsp;
<p>%unistats: 10Jul06: misspct=yes was having its displayed percentage
blanked out. Fixed on 10Jul06.&nbsp;
<p>%unistats: 06Jul06: catn= setting caused macro to crash. Fixed on 07Jul06.&nbsp;
