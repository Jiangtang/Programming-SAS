<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b>"Triple Test Pack Validation"</b> is a method for <b>validating distributed
sas macros</b>. By "distributed sas macros" is meant sas macros written
by an author for other non-connected users to use. The method was designed
by Roland Rashleigh-Berry on the 04 August 2007. The method is fully explained
and formalized on this page and no other formal definition of this methodolgy
exists elsewhere. A date is put in the second title line to make it clear
when this document was updated and hence the methodology possibly refined
or clarified.
<h2>
Why the need</h2>
The need for this specific method of sas macro validation arises from the
widespread sharing of sas macros that is most commonly distributed through
the medium of the Internet. There are a lot of useful sas macros available
but they are used less often than it could be due to their lack of being
"validated". The methodology is for the benefit of both the macro author
who wishes their macros to be used and the end users who require that sas
macros be <b>validated</b> before they can be used. Since the author of
the sas macros and the end user are entirely unconnected, a different method
for validation is needed as the macro author is unaware of and is not bound
by any of the end user's SOPs for developing and writing code. Some method
is needed for the author to pass on their own validation work on the macros
that reflects the author's intended use of the macro is required in a way
that is complete and fully documented that could somehow tie in with the
end user's requirements for validation purposes. "<b>Triple test pack validation</b>"
aims to fill that need.
<h2>
Sort of macros to test</h2>
The type of macros to be validated in the way described here are <b>simple
macros</b>. For complex reporting macros with many parameters, this method
is also a possibility but there are easier ways of performing validation.
For that situation I recommend "Restricted Usage Validation", as I will
explain. For demography reporting, for example, perhaps only a few parameters
of a complex reporting macro might be used so it would be easier to validate
the code that calls the macro to produce the demography report rather than
validate the entire functionality of the macro being called to produce
the report. Double programming might be done to validate such a report
and then the macro or code member that calls the complex macro could be
regarded as validated while the complex macro itself remains unvalidated.
<h2>
Type of validation</h2>
The type of validation done is testing that the output of the macro is
correct and conforms to what it should be, as described in the purpose
of the macro. It is purely <b>functionality testing</b>. An expected result
and an actual result are compared and marked as "equal" if they are equal
and "not equal" if not equal. There is no "code review" or "peer review"
done on the macro code itself, as the author is not connected to the end
user and therefore the author can not be expected to conform to the end
user's programming standards or SOPs. However, the macro purpose and parameters
will be looked at and these should be clear.
<h2>
How it works in simple terms</h2>
In simple terms, the author of a macro who intends for it to be distributed
must do some extra work. In the header of their code they must clearly
explain the purpose of the macro and briefly describe every parameter and
how they should be used. In addition, they have to provide a detailed <b>test
pack</b> that demonstrates that the macro works correctly and as advertised
and the author has to test all the parameters of the macro (except where
there are groups of parameters that perform the same function such as parm1-parm9,
in which case only the first two parameters need be tested). The <b>header</b>
of the test pack is in <b>three parts</b> corresponding to <b>three levels
of checking</b> which gives rise to the name "<b>triple test pack validation</b>".
The author fills in the first part of the header, following the instructions,
to indicate when they have validated the macro. This is <b>level one</b>
testing. <b>Level two</b> testing is done by an independent programmer
who would typically be a programmer who also writes sas software and distributes
it. This independent programmer reviews the tests done by the program author
and adds their own tests (at least one) to convince themselves that the
macro is fulfilling its purpose, as described in the header, and is working
correctly. When they are sure it is working correctly they fill in their
part of the header, according to the instructions. <b>Level three</b> testing
is done by the end user and is more like <b>user acceptance testing</b>.
This last part of the checking is dependent on the in-house SOPs allowing
validation to be done this way. The end user must review the testing done
on the macro to see if it is satisfactory. It is the end user who must
decide whether the macro is suitable for their purposes and if so, whether
the degree of testing done reflects the way the macro will be used within
their own organisation. If deemed suitable for the purpose, but not tested
to the degree required, then the end user will have to enhance the testing
in the test pack. If both suitable for the purpose and the end user has
reviewed the testing done both by the programmer and independent programmer
and considers it to be sufficient then they can fill in their part of the
header and by dating it, mark it as validated, and then the validation
of the macro is complete. The test pack and sas log then get stored in
a safe place and the macro is then ready for use as a "validated" macro.
<h2>
Testing order</h2>
Where macros are dependent on other macros then those macros at the lowest
level should be validated first to avoid the situation where a macro is
calling another macro that has not undergone any testing.
<h2>
The header</h2>
The header of any macro being tested does not get changed by the "triple
test pack" validation process, such as adding the validator and the validation
date. It is the test pack header that gets changed. If validation information
needs to be linked to the macro being tested then this can be done by other
means such as using a script to link with the validation status held elsewhere
or maybe there is software like Clearcase to keep a history for the macro
that records "promotion to QC" dates and validation dates.
<p>The test pack header has three sections. Each section has instructions
on how to fill it in and contain fields that must be filled in that clearly
indicate if the validation work has been done. In the code section there
are clearly labelled segments where the program author, the independent
tester and optionally the user acceptance checker adds their test code.
The header can be linked to <a href="macros/testhdr.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>
Bug reporting</h2>
It is hoped that after a macro has been through the first two stages of
testing then there will be no bugs in a macro. To remind the reader, this
method of testing is meant for simple macros, so finding a bug at the user
acceptance stage, after two layers of testing, should be unlikely. Where
it might occur is where the value supplied to a parameter is unexpected
and the macro does not deal with this unexpected situation in the way the
user would like. Bugs should be reported back to the macro author. If the
author recognises it as a bug and fixes it then the macro can be updated
and testing started again with the macro author rerunning the test pack.
There is no need for the second level testing to be done again, by the
independent programmer, unless the macro author has extended the functionality
of the macro as evidenced by updating the version number. If the macro
author does not consider that the bug reported really is a bug then the
user will have to decide what to do. They might issue a warning to internal
users about what the macro can not cope with. They might amend or rewrite
the macro in-house and follow their own internal procedures for validation
or they might abandon the intention to use the macro.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
In this document I have set out a plan for validating sas macros in a way
that I hope can link in with an end user's SOPs for macro validation that
will minimise the end user's efforts in the validation process.
