<h1>
Why I like Spectre (Clinical)</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
I thought I would put on this page all the reasons why I like Spectre (Clinical).
Obviously, I am going to be biased, as I wrote the system, but I thought
it would be useful to have a page where my thinking about this clinical
reporting system "shines through" as I feel it is the ideas behind it which
make it such a good system and "tuning in" to these ideas might reveal
facets of the system design that would otherwise be overlooked.
<p><b>This page is historic</b> but most of the comments still stand. The
<b>Clinical reporting macros are no longer free</b> but the rest of the
system is free. Since the following page was written there have been major
upgrades to the reporting macros but they still act as a tool to aid programmer
creativity rather than as a substitute for their skills.

<h2>
What makes Spectre (Clinical) so good</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Programmer Popularity</b>. The old Glaxo Wellcome system, on which Spectre
(Clinical) is based, was in use for eleven years and was <b>popular</b>
among the <b>SAS&reg;</b> programmers in the company. Now there are two
diametrically opposed points of view on whether it matters if a reporting
system is <b>popular</b> among sas programmers. From a management point
of view, it might be considered that if a reporting system is in place
that will result in greater efficiency then the programmers should get
used to it or go elsewhere. On the other hand, programmers tend to be creative
and if they are limited in their creativeness by the reporting system they
have to use then they will be unhappy and perhaps less productive. The
reason I thought the Glaxo Wellcome system was popular among programmers
was because it gave them tools that <b>aided them in their creativity</b>.
The system was not "overdeveloped" to the point where programmers were
setting parameters to get their output and had no understanding of the
processes underneath. Instead, the Glaxo Wellcome system took away the
tedium of certain programming tasks and helped them to be creative. The
two main reporting macros in the Glaxo Wellcome system were called %aetab
and %sumtab and I have replaced these with <a href="npcttab.html" target="_blank">%npcttab</a>
and <a href="unistats.html" target="_blank">%unistats</a> and in a way
that still allows the programmer to work with them and <b>think</b> with
them. It is this "<b>thinking</b>" with the macros that I consider to be
important. These macros can produce output datasets where all the tedious
work of coding the "proc univariate" steps and "proc summary" steps are
taken care of, leaving the programmer with a dataset that they are free
to manipulate and present in any way they like. They might calculate complex
p-values and merge them in with these output datasets and put the dataset
through "proc report" to produce sophisticated efficacy tables. With the
macros being so flexible, then almost any report that shows patient counts
with percentages can be produced using the %npcttab macro, once you understand
how the macro works, and combined with the %unistats macro then almost
all safety tables can be produced as well. The ease of using the macros,
plus their output datasets, allow programmers to effortlessly cross the
boundary between safety and efficacy programming. A lot of reporting systems
are so heavily developed on the safety reporting side and have become so
complex that it forms a split, creating an "efficacy reporting function"
and a "safety reporting function". This is not the case with Spectre, where
the two roles naturally converge into one.</li>

<li>
<b>p-values</b>. The macros %npcttab and %unistats are heavily loaded with
p-values capabilities (if this is required) and it is possible to display
these p-values not only in a column but in footnotes instead. Some clients
tend to be "p-value happy" and require p-values to be shown, even in demography
and for baseline values, so it is important to have this reporting capability
in your standard reporting macros. %npcttab and %unistats has this. Because
of their advanced p-value capabilities, these two "safety" macros become
"efficacy" macros and encourages safety programmers to become efficacy
programmers and efficacy programmers to become safety programmers. I think
it is a good thing if programmers feel happy in both fields and I hope
it leads to greater flexibility.</li>

<li>
<b>Push-button Reporting</b>. Spectre (Clinical) encourages the use of
reporting macros. As soon as your <b>autoexec.sas</b> has completed then
all your macros for a study should have been assigned. If you have got
a complete set of reporting macros then they are ready to be called. Spectre
allows you to define macro calls in the titles members using the "sascode"
line. This single line of code then becomes your sas program. Suppose your
table templates could be linked to your macros such that if you chose a
template then it would match it with the macro call then you have the chance
of creating a push-button reporting system such that if the titles and
footnotes are chosen along with the table template then everything will
have been selected to produce the final report as defined to the titles
member. No other reporting system that I know of has a suitable architecture
to come so close to being a push-button reporting system in the way I describe.
And if the CDISC project results in people reporting from these standard
datasets, then standard macros could be written to report these datasets
and the goal of a push-button reporting system could be achieved.</li>

<li>
<b>A Universal Reporting System</b>. Spectre can be downloaded for free.
The reporting macros %npcttab and %unistats will run on any platform SAS
runs on and if people want to use the full Spectre system then that will
work on both Windows and *nix platforms. It is the first, free universal
clinical reporting system that I know of and I think it makes a lot of
sense to use it as such. I note the major pharmaceutical companies spend
millions of dollars developing their own in-house reporting systems and
yet farm out most of their work to to CROs who they do not allow to use
their in-house systems, even if they have been validated, due to copyright
issues and the possibility that the CRO would use their system for their
own advantage (why not let them -- who loses money?). Often, these in-house
systems are so overdeveloped and complex that their own permanent programming
staff members, due to the frequent organizational communications and interruptions
that is typical of a large company, are unable to concentrate on working
with the system for long enough periods to maintain an understanding and
familiarity of the system. I would guess it takes 15 minutes of concentrated
effort to "get back into" a complex system before the programmer can start
being productive with it and by that time they may have been interrupted
more than once and are unable to make any progress. And so the organization
becomes reliant on external contract staff, who are subject to less distractions,
to work with the system with the resulting added expense.&nbsp; I have
to wonder if the money spent was worth it when there is a system like Spectre
that people can use for free, is easy to use and understand and most likely
has far more features and is far more flexible and reliable than those
systems written in-house. I would suggest that these companies drop their
in-house systems and use Spectre instead and ask that the CROs do the same
-- and then everything would run a lot smoother.</li>

<li>
<b>Multiple client styles</b>. Spectre was designed to produce output in
multiple client styles. The location of titles and footnotes plus various
headers such as protocol, report number and increments is handled by the
client titles macro. If your client has the abbreviation "xy", for example,
then a macro named %xytitles will be called to create the headers and footnotes
to match that client's style. This makes the system so much more of a universal
reporting system in that it allows you to write reporting macros that are
independent of client layout requirements. Much greater efficiencies are
possible in this way and I feel a satisfaction in that regard in using
Spectre.</li>

<li>
<b>Batch is Fast</b>. I know it will be inconceivable to anyone who has
always worked through a GUI interface that working in Unix batch and typing
all your commands through terminal windows can be easier and faster but
I can assure you from personal experience that it is. The speed increase
can be several-fold, once you know your Unix commands. You can work up
to an incredible speed using Spectre. Its demands on processor power is
low and network traffic is minimized by working in batch, so it runs faster
and your screen refreshes quicker than would be the case if you worked
through a GUI. When you are working at high speed, you want your computer
to give quick responses too. Spectre is ideal for this.</li>

<li>
<b>Programs run automatically</b>. You don't need to keep a list of what
programs need to run, only to find that after the final run and with tight
timescales, a few of your outputs are missing. Spectre keeps track of what
programs are there. For the derived datasets build programs it goes by
the program name and for the output programs the program names are all
held in the titles dataset and it uses that to generate a list of all the
programs that need to be run. Another plus is it checks to make sure you
do not have more than one table or listing with the same reference number.
A small extra is that it e-mails the Spectre Administrator to tell them
when all the programs finish and tells them whether it worked or not. It
allows the Administrator to get on with other tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
Here, I have set out, and in my personal opinion only, some of my thinking
on why Spectre (Clinical) is such a good reporting system.
