<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This document advises on how to work with Spectre (Clinical) which is a
"back end" batch system.
<h2>
Use the programs directory for development</h2>
Before anything else, if you are using Spectre then <b>all your programs
using SAS&reg; software must be developed in the programs directory for
a study</b>. Do not develop programs in your home area. Whether you develop
code interactively or in batch, this rule must be strictly observed. And
now for&nbsp; the rest....
<p>I guess most people develop their programs using SAS software interactively
these days. Some, like me, have always done their development work in batch.
I know habits are hard to break and changing from interactive development
to batch development might take a long time, but the way Spectre is designed,
it is much quicker to do all your development in batch. This is because
there have been a lot of Unix shell scripts written that you will need
to use and these are launched from the terminal window.
<p><b>The final output run will be in batch so, for QC purposes, you should
work as closely as possible to that method</b>. In the final output run,
each program will be run using the script "<b>sasb"</b> which will give
a count of error messages, warning and messages of interest such as zero
observations. You will have to check all of these. Details of the messages
can be displayed using the script "<b>sc"</b> (short for <b>sc</b>an logs).
So even if you are editing your program using an interactive SAS session,
you should run it from the terminal window using "sasb" and check the log
messages using "sc". It should also be noted that in the final run, every
program will be run independently using separate invocations of "sasb".
This avoids any potential problem of one program affecting another and
is the only sure way to know that the program that has passed its QC will
work in an identical way for the final run.
<h2>
Batch for the final run</h2>
It seems that any software company that creates clinical trials reporting
systems assumes that the pharmaceutical companies want to see results interactively.
Sometimes this is useful for when departments with no programmers want
to see ad-hoc tables but when the final run is done to build datasets and
produce output then all pharmaceutical companies I know of do this in batch.
They need to keep complete records of who did what and when and this is
difficult if a person is using an interactive system, so pure batch is
preferred. <b>Spectre is most definitely a batch-based system with full
logging of who launches the final run, when it starts and when it ends
and it keeps the return codes that come out of "sasb" for every program
run</b>.
<h2>
Emulating an interactive SAS&reg; session</h2>
To make working in batch easier, I have written some scripts to emulate
a SAS session. Before you can use it you have to set up a Unix system environment
variable named "<b>prog</b>" that is set to the name of the program you
are working on (but without the ".sas" extension). If your program is "t_fpatdem.sas"
then you would define it to the Unix variable "prog" like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>prog=t_fpatdem</tt>
<br><tt>export prog</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The "export prog" command has only to be done once per terminal window.
It "promotes" the variable to being "global" so that other scripts you
use can be aware that it is there (it is like declaring a SAS software
macro variable as %global).
<p>Once your program name has been assigned to "prog" and exported, then
there are other scripts you can use to emulate a SAS interactive session.
They call
<b>dtpad</b> (or nedit) in either edit mode or browse mode. "<b>pgm</b>"
will open up your ".sas" file in edit mode. "<b>log</b>" will open the
log in browse mode. "<b>lst</b>" will open the .lst file in browse mode.
"<b>lis</b>" will open up your .lis file (".lis" files are explained in
another section - they are effectively .lst files with page number added).
The abbreviations "pgm", "log" and "lst" are borrowed from interactive
SAS sessions. If used on the command line then they will take you to those
windows. So what I have done with these scripts is make interactive users
of SAS software "feel at home" if they swap over to using batch.
<p>(Note that I have introduced some scripts in the above paragraph. All
scripts introduced on a page will be listed at the top of the page. If
you look at the top of this page you will see these scripts listed plus
some more).
<h2>
Setting up titles</h2>
Before I go into how to create titles (and footnotes), I want to explain
why titles are kept separate from program code. Maybe you are not used
to this and have always put titles statements in with your reporting code.
The reason titles are kept separate, with any reporting system, is because
titles change from study to study but reporting macros should be reused,
for the sake of efficiency. The main point of having a reporting system
is to produce output efficiently. If you have to edit a reporting macro
to change titles then this is not efficient and the macro is not reusable.
If it is reusable then the macro should not be edited. It might even be
"read only" in which case you would not be able to edit it. So since titles
are changeable and you want reporting macros to remain stable, you put
the changeable elements somewhere else. So the <b>changeable titles</b>
are to go in a "titles" member, later to be read in by SAS software code
and placed in a dataset. Notice that I highlighted "changeable titles"
because not all titles change. Suppose you called a reporting macro for
AEs and you set a flag that said you only wanted "serious" AEs. Then it
might be better if the macro set up the term "serious AEs" in a title inside
the macro. That way there is less chance of making a mistake. So you might
have a changeable title with the label "Table 1.2.1" but have other non-changeable
titles generated inside the macro. In this case you would only keep the
"Table 1.2.1" separate because it is a changeable title. The same applies
to the footnotes. If the footnotes are closely related to what the reporting
macro is creating, then you would keep the footnotes in the macro code
and not put them in the titles member.
<p>So now we come to creating our <b><i>changeable</i></b> titles (and
footnotes). Assuming you are working in batch mode, this is how to set
up titles. Your titles file name will match your program name but have
the extension ".titles". If you know another titles member that closely
matches the program defined to "prog" then you can copy it across like
this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>cp oldprog.titles $prog.titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But if you want to start with a fresh set of titles (or wish to edit
the current titles) then just run the command "titles" like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>titles</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When you do this, an editor window is opened with your titles information.
A fresh set of titles is shown below. It was created for the program "t_fpatdem"
and you will see that this program name was added automatically. The header
contains instructions on how to fill in the details. Right at the top of
the header, in the second line, it says "You must only have ONE set of
titles in this file". Certainly you will not be allowed to have multiple
entries for different programs. But you <b><i>can</i></b> have multiple
entries for the <b><i>same </i></b>program, though your site standards
may strongly discourage this. But sometimes you have no choice, despite
site standards. For example, if you use "proc lifetest" then you will probably
create a table from the output dataset but you will need to put the output
from the procedure into a listing. You should not have a separate program
- one for the table and one for the procedure output - because you have
to be sure the procedure output exactly matches the information in your
table. So in this case, no matter what your site standards are, you will
need two entries - one for the table and one for the listing. To add an
extra entry, just copy the block where you enter information and place
it below. You then have to add a "label" line and give the label a value
like "a" like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>program: t_fpatdem</tt>
<br><b><tt>label: a</tt></b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It is best to put the "label:" line under the "program:" line. Your
output file will normally have the extension ".lis" (like a .lst file but
with page numbers added) but if you use the label "a" then the extension
will be ".lisa". The label suffixes the extension. And whereas the command
"<b>lis</b>" (mentioned above) will open the output file with a ".lis"
extension in a browser window, the command "<b>lis a</b>" will open the
output file with a ".lisa" extension in a browser window.

<p>If you look at the entry above, you will see that I have chosen a portrait
10 point font size layout. The population is "fas" and this will match
one of the populations set up in the file "protocol.txt" by the administrator.
The first title is "Table 13.2.1" and the second title is "PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS".
The first title is definitely a changeable title and so should go in this
file but "Patient Demographics", at first sight, looks like it should go
in the reporting macro because it is a stable title. But sometimes you
have "subjects" in a study rather than "patients" (they may be healthy
volunteers) so because this word might change I have put it in the titles
file and left it out of the reporting macro. There are no footnotes defined
above. There will be footnotes in the report but these are closely linked
to what the reporting macro is doing.
<p>Now take a look at the "sascode:" entry above. This will be explained
further in the next section.
<h2>
Using sascode:</h2>
In my titles member for t_fpatdem I defined some SAS software code to the
"sascode:" line as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>sascode: %inc alloc m_patdem; %m_patdem</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above is real SAS software code that will be used to create the
report. Because something is defined to "sascode:", a dummy program using
SAS software code will be generated with this program code in - namely
"<tt>%inc alloc m_patdem; %m_patdem</tt>".
<b>Note that the dummy program
generated will have the same name as your titles member but with the extension
".sas" so do not both use sascode: and have a genuine program of that name
as it will get overwritten</b>. This is a real example from a study I am
working on at the moment. In an ideal world, the entry would simply be:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>sascode: %m_patdem</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>...but I have to call a macro named "%alloc" to allocate libraries and
since the study program library is not defined to the "sasautos" path,
which contains the study specific macros I am using, then I have to <b>inc</b>lude
the macro "m_patdem" before I can use it. In an ideal world, this allocation
of libraries and adding all the macros you need to the "sasautos" path
should be done when you invoke SAS software. Using "sascode:" like this,
and putting calls to reporting macros in the titles member, is the <b><i>power
of Spectre
</i></b>and how it aims at the <b><i>ultimate goal of producing
reports directly from the data</i></b>. This is why I wrote Spectre. It
is intended to be used in this way for tables, at least. <b>You should
aim to produce as many tables as you can using a short call to a reporting
macro in the "sascode:" entry as shown above</b>.
<h2>
Special characters in titles and footnotes</h2>
Sometimes it is a requirement to have a percent sign "<b>%</b>" or an ampersand
sign "<b>&amp;</b>" in titles or footnotes. This can cause problems to
SAS software as a percent sign can signal that a macro must be run and
an ampersand sign can signal that a macro variable should be resolved.
To get around this problem, these characters will be translated to something
else and changed back later. But sometimes you will want to resolve some
macro variables in your titles or footnotes. This might be a set of standard
footnotes that you want all programmers to use. To allow you to do this,
<b>macro
variable references will be resolved only if the macro variable name start
with an underscore</b>. But remember that global macro variables that both
start and end with an underscore are reserved by the reporting system.
You must not create them yourself. But you can create your own macro variables
that only <b><i>start </i></b>with an underscore.
<p>There are two global macro variables you will use in your titles or
footnotes. <b>&amp;_poplabel_</b> is the population label. If the titles
macro sees that defined to the titles in the titles member then it will
resolve it and the client titles macro should not repeat it after the titles,
if the macro works in that way. Another very common first footnote is <b>&amp;_longline_</b>
which resolves to a line of underscores that is the same width as the page.
It is traditional to have this as a footnote, even if it is the only one,
as it gives the message to anyone reading the report that no lines of data
have been accidentally missed off due to a truncated file (or the printer
running out of toner/ink). The complete list of global macro variables
set up is covered on the page that deals with the %titles macro, the next
page to read (you can link to it <a href="titles.html">here</a>) but &amp;_poplabel_
and &amp;_longline_ are the only ones you will need to remember for use
in titles and footnotes. Here is an example of these being used in a titles
member.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>titles below:</tt>
<br><tt>TABLE 13.4.5.1</tt>
<br><tt>PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS - &amp;_poplabel_</tt>
<br><tt>footnotes below:</tt>
<br><tt>&amp;_longline_</tt>
<br><tt>endxxx:</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Creating the titles dataset</h2>
Setting up a titles member will have no effect until you run the script
"<b>crtitlesds</b>" which is short for (create titles dataset). When you
invoke this script, SAS software will read in this file and put your titles
in a "titles dataset". The script takes no arguments or parameters. You
use it like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>crtitlesds</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When invoked it will run on <b><i>all titles members</i></b> owned by
<b><i>all
programmers</i></b> in that directory. It will do error checking to make
sure the the table reference number is not already in use and it will check
that the program name used in the titles member matches the file name of
the titles member.
<p>When you start using Spectre you will often forget to run the "crtitlesds"
script after making changes. Even I forget, sometimes, and I have been
using the system for two years. For example, you may need ot use more columns
so you might change the layout to use a smaller font. You run your code
again and nothing has changed. That is because you forgot to run "crtitlesds"
to update the information in the titles dataset.
<h2>
The sascode: generated program</h2>
If you define something to "sascode:" then a program will be automatically
generated with that code in when you invoke the "crtitlesds" script. It
will overwrite anything that is already there so you should take care you
do not lose some code you want to keep. And it is no good editing the sas
program generated, since it will get overwritten next time "crtitlesds"
is invoked. In the case of "t_fpatdem" this is the sas code generated:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>/*</tt>
<br><tt>/ Program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : t_fpatdem.sas</tt>
<br><tt>/ Author&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Automatically generated
by the "crtitlesds" script</tt>
<br><tt>/ Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;
8-Feb-2006 at 08:39:31</tt>
<br><tt>/ Drug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : XXXXX_xxx</tt>
<br><tt>/ Protocol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : xx_xx_xx</tt>
<br><tt>/ Increment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : xxx</tt>
<br><tt>/ Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Do not edit
this member as it will get overwritten next time</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"crtitlesds" is run. If you wish to change the code you must</tt>
<br><tt>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
change it in the .titles member.</tt>
<br><tt>/==============================================================================*/</tt>
<p><tt>%inc alloc m_patdem; %m_patdem</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Browsing your titles entry</h2>
If there are multiple programmers working on a study then the titles dataset
will be updated every time one of the programmers invokes the "crtitlesds"
script. For this they will need write access, so if anybody is browsing
the dataset they will not be able to update it. For this reason I wrote
the script "<b>showtitles</b>" that will display what is in the titles
dataset in your terminal window. It reads the titles dataset in a fraction
of a second and then releases it, so it does not stop other programmers
from updating the titles dataset when they invoke "crtitlesds".
<p>Here is what I get when I use it for t_fpatdem (which has been defined
to the Unix variable "prog"):
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>showtitles $prog</tt>
<p><tt>Program: t_fpatdem</tt>
<br><tt>Label:</tt>
<br><tt>Population: FAS</tt>
<br><tt>Layout: P10</tt>
<br><tt>Sascode: %inc alloc m_patdem; %m_patdem</tt>
<br><tt>Titles below:</tt>
<br><tt>Table 13.2.1</tt>
<br><tt>PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You might think it is reading your titles member, but it is definitely
reading the titles dataset. You will see, from the above, that the "label"
is a blank and it does not show footnotes as there are none in the titles
dataset.
<p>Note that if you use the command "showtitles" it will show you <b><i>all
</i></b>the
titles entries. Not just for you but for the other programmers as well.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how to set up titles. How you call them into a program is
explained on a different page. You have been introduced to a number of
scripts, all of which are listed at the top of this page. It has also been
explained to you how to use the full power of Spectre by using the "<b>sascode:</b>"
entry to produce your table with a short call to a reporting macro.
