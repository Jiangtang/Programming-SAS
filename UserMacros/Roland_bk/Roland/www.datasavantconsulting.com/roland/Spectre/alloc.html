<h2>
Introduction</h2>
It is likely that you already have a method for allocating macros libraries,
data libraries and format libraries. I know that changing your established
system for doing this is going to be difficult but <b>Spectre has some
minimal needs</b> that must be satisfied and these will be explained on
this page.
<h2>
Macros and the sasautos path</h2>
What Spectre needs from the <b>autoexec.sas</b>, and <b>the only thing
it needs</b>, is for all the macros it might call to be declared to <b>sasautos</b>
such that they are all allocated, and in the correct order, by the time
<b>autoexec.sas</b>
has finished processing. If you are doing study reporting then you will
have to detect if sas is being invoked from a study reporting area and
define all the macros relevant for that study. If you are invoking sas
from an area that is nothing to do with study reporting then you will only
need the Spectre macros and the supplied SASAUTOS defined to the sasautos
path. You must set some system options for Spectre, namely "<b>noovp nodate
nonumber xsync noxwait</b>", so this should also be in your autoexec.sas.
<p>It is up to you whether you use a high-level <b>autoexec.sas</b> member
for all users or place autoexec.sas in the directory from which you will
invoke sas, in which case that one will be used instead. Maybe you will
use a mix such that some study programs have their own autoexec while others
use the high-level one. I am currently using a high-level autoexec on my
PC and if I am in the study reporting area (the "pharma" directory hanging
off the C: drive) then I assign study reporting macros. I list the contents
of sasautos at the end and I recommend you do the same. Keeping in mind
that this is for Windows-style path names, feel free to look at the code
inside my <a href="macros/autoexec.html" target="_blank">autoexec.sas</a>
(best viewed as a source file).
<h2>
%allocr and %allocw</h2>
Most of the Spectre scripts that call sas also call a macro named <b>%allocr</b>
or <b>%allocw</b> (allocation macro for read and write respectively) and
their code will have to be written for each site Spectre is installed.
They allocate the dataset libraries and formats. Unless you want to change
the shell scripts then these two macros are mandatory. It is important
for QC purposes to have two macros, one to allocate datasets in read mode
and the other in write mode, because you should not to allocate datasets
in write mode for sas programs that only need read access.
<p>It is possible to have these allocations macros as high-level macros
but I am using low-level macros that do this. I have included two examples
of these low-level macros below which are kept in one of my study increment
macros directories on my PC. These macros are only good for the one study
increment. They are not generic. They are not part of Spectre and not supported.

<h2>
The Reporting Directory Structure</h2>
It will be helpful if you used a consistent directory structure. On my
PC I have a folder named "pharma" in which all clinical reporting work
is done. Underneath that I have a single imaginary client named "xenuyama"
with an office in Tokyo. The have a drug named "DRUG001C" with a single
protocol "DRUG001C3001" and for now, a "24weeks" increment. This is my
directory structure downwards from the "pharma" directory. The output comes
from the script <a href="scripts/dirtree" target="_blank">dirtree</a>.

<h2>
Drug, study and increment macros</h2>
You will likely have reporting macros that must exist at the increment
level, the study level and the drug level. Maybe even at the office level
and client level if you have different clients. Macros stored at the lower
levels should override those at the higher levels so they should be earlier
in the sasautos path. You will have to <b>be careful about your macro names</b>
so that you do not accidentally override the spectre macros when you need
to use them, although on rare occasions you might need an amended version
of a Spectre macro. All these macros should be assigned to the sasautos
path in your autoexec.sas member if you are invoking sas from the clinical
reporting area. Bearing in mind that I have Cygwin on my PC so all the
directory names are Windows style, you can see the way I define the macros
to the sasautos path it in my <a href="macros/autoexec.html" target="_blank">autoexec.sas</a>
(best viewed as a source file).
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
For Spectre to work correctly it was explained that all macros should be
assigned to sasautos in the correct order in your <b>autoexec.sas</b> member.
You might call another macro to set up sasautos within your autoexec.sas
but when it completes it should have been done. Allocation of datasets
and the format search path should&nbsp; be done in the allocation macros
%allocr and %allocw.
