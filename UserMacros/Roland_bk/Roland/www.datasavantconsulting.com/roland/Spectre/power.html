Power Reporting using Spectre (Clinical)</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This document will give you information on how to get the maximum benefit
from Spectre (Clinical) and how to work at speed with it.
<h2>
Validating reporting macros</h2>
The get the full benefits from Spectre, you need to validate the reporting
macros you use. This applies not only to the Spectre reporting macros themselves,
such as %npcttab and %unistats and their sub-macros, but other macros that
you write that might call these macros, such as for lab tables. You should
aim at building up a comprehensive set of reporting macros that can be
used for reporting different studies and have them fully validated and
stored in a read-only library. This should be done in accordance with your
Standard Operating Procedures with test pack(s), full documentation and
change controls applied. Although this is a lot of work to do up-front,
it will save a lot of validation effort and time in the long run.
<p>Before leaving this topic, you have to consider how you are going to
design your reporting macros that you are going to validate.
<h2>
Designing reporting macros</h2>
The reporting macro you will validate must be stable and not have to be
amended from study to study, or you will have to do the validation work
every time. It is likely that your data selection rules will vary from
study to study. If this selection of data can be easily done by passing
one or a few parameters to a study reporting macro, then it is best to
do it like that. Hopefully, you have useful flags in your data to simplify
the data selection process. But then again, your data structure might vary
from study to study and so having a generic macro to handle data selection
as well might be difficult. If that is the case, this data selection part
should be left out of your reporting macro. Instead, the reporting macro
should work on your data <b><i>after </i></b>you have made the selection.
Your reporting macro would not be generic if you had to change the code
inside the macro and nor could it be "validated" in any sense of the word.
So, if you can, have the macro validated and self-contained so that you
can easily select on the data you want by setting parameters. That way
the macro could be called in your "<b>sascode:</b>" line in your titles
member. But if this is not possible then the macro should be designed to
be called after you have made the data selection in your code.
<h2>
Data selection rules</h2>
The data selection rules should be clear for every reporting program you
create. Even with validated macros, your data selection rules will need
to be QC'ed. This will likely be done with a code review so it is important
that both the programmer and the QC programmer know what the selection
rules are for the data. There should be a reference document for this that
lists the data selection rules for each and every table.
<h2>
Utility macros</h2>
You should never need to write a non-statistical utility macro so if you
feel you need one then check all the existing macros as it is 99% certain
that it already exists somewhere. Be aware of what macros already exist
within Spectre. You can see a complete list of these macros and their purposes
<a href="maclist2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
If you don't see what you want then try the list of macros on my old web
site. Nearly every single macro in Spectre originally came from the old
web
site. You can see the complete list <a href="../maclist2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
I spent since 1986 building up that collection so the list is fairly complete,
but if you do spot the need for a utility macro (non-statistical) that
I haven't thought of then send me an e-mail.
<h2>
Setting up and exporting Unix variables for studies</h2>
If you are working on multiple studies then you need a quick method of
moving to these study folders. You can set up Unix variables for this in
your <b>.bashrc</b> member or <b>.bashrc_own</b> or whatever is the file
in your home directory you are allowed to edit. A study might have a <b>p</b>rograms
folder, a <b>d</b>erived datasets folder, a <b>s</b>tats dataset folder
and a <b>r</b>aw dataset folder. If this study could be meaningfully referred
to as "abc" then you could set up variables and export them like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>abcp=/data/sas/xxx/pr0g/drug/study/inc/programs</tt>
<br><tt>abcd=/data/sas/xxx/data/drug/study/inc/der&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>abcs=/data/sas/xxx/data/drug/study/inc/stat&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>abcr=/data/sas/xxx/data/drug/study/inc/rawdata</tt>
<br><tt>export abcp abcd abcs abcr</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Once you have done this for all the studies you might be working on
then it is easy to move to a folder of your choice using these Unix variables
like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>cd $abcp</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>And once you have done your work in that folder then you can return
to the previous folder using the command:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>cd -</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These Unix variables are useful in other Unix commands. For example,
here is how you would copy all the macros owned by you (assuming they match
the pattern m_*.sas) from the programs folder of study "abc" into your
current folder:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>cp $(myfiles $abcp/m_*.sas) .</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
aliases</h2>
While we are on the subject of editing our <b>.bashrc</b> (or <b>.bashrc_own</b>)
members, there are always aliases we can set up in it to save ourselves
a bit of time. I have aliased the "crtitlesds" command to "crt" as I use
it thousands of times so I wanted to make it shorter, plus I have other
aliases set up. Here is an extract from my <b>.bashrc</b> file:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>alias rm='rm -i'</tt>
<br><tt>alias cp='cp -i'</tt>
<br><tt>alias p='echo $prog'</tt>
<br><tt>alias c='cat $prog.titles|grep ^sascode:'</tt>
<br><tt>alias r='cat $prog.titles|egrep -i "^table |^appendix "'</tt>
<br><tt>alias dtv='dtpad -viewOnly '</tt>
<br><tt>alias crt='crtitlesds'</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You will see from the above that I have aliased a few things so that
I can extract information from my .titles member quickly. "<b>p</b>" will
give me my current program name, "<b>c</b>" will give me my "sascode:"
entry and "<b>r</b>" will give me my table/appendix reference number. I
could enter the command "titles" and just look inside my .titles member
instead, but using these aliases saves me a tiny amount of time and multiplied
by a thousand or more, it makes it worthwhile to set them up.
<h2>
xterm windows</h2>
One of the advantages of Spectre over a web based system is that by staying
close to Unix you have a host of useful utilities at your disposal. You
can also use as many xterm windows as you wish so that you could have windows
with "cd" set to directories in different studies at the same time. I normally
work with three xterm windows and add more as required using the command
below which opens a new window while keeping the current window active:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>xterm &amp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can customize the xterm windows and I do this to reduce eye strain.
I find the default black text on a white background too tiring to look
at for long periods so I change the background colour. I also do this for
interactive SAS&reg; software sessions. You can either create or edit an
existing file in your home directory named <b>.Xdefaults</b> to customize
your xterm windows. This is what I have in my own <b>.Xdefaults</b> file.
Lines starting with a "<b>!</b>" are treated as comment lines. You will
see that I have set my background colour for xterm windows to "AntiqueWhite".
Note that for SAS software interactive sessions the background is set to
"wheat" except <b>I have commented it out</b> because it does not work
for me any more.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>xterm*background: AntiqueWhite&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>xterm*geometry: 81x24&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>!sas*background: wheat&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>!xterm*foreground: black&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>ghostscript*background: white&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>ghostscript*foreground: black&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>!ghostscript*useXPutImage: false&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>!ghostscript*useXSetTile: false&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>!ghostscript*useBackingPixmap: false</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For changing the background color of my <b>interactive sas</b> sessions,
I used to be able to do it as shown above with the "<b>sas*background:
wheat</b>" entry but that does not work for me any more. Now I do it by
using "<b>reshelper</b>" instead, called from the toolbox command box.
If you click on the "Colors" button and double-click on the background
color "white" (or whatever the background is set to) and select a different
color (from the list displayed) then that color will replace the white
(this only works for Unix/Linux).
<h2>
"fsv" scripts</h2>
You have a number of scripts at your disposal to allow you to browse SAS
software datasets directly from the Unix command line in the current directory.
You will find using these is easier than starting up an interactive SAS
software session and also better. You should get used to using these as
they will speed your work. They are as follows:
<blockquote>
<li>
<a href="scripts/fsv" target="_blank">fsv</a>: Browse a dataset with all
formats applied</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/fsvraw" target="_blank">fsvraw</a>: Browse a dataset with
no user formats applied</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/fsvdc" target="_blank">fsvdc</a>: Browse a dataset with
user formatted fields shown unformatted and formatted next to each other</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/fsvacct" target="_blank">fsvacct</a>: Browse a dataset
with fields from the acct dataset merged in as specified</li>
</blockquote>

<h2>
"contents" scripts</h2>
There are two scripts that do a "proc contents" on the specified datasets
or a whole library that you should find more useful than running "proc
contents" yourself. The reason being, these scripts put the output in a
form that can be passed to other Unix utilities. Suppose you wanted to
know what variables were in what datasets that were something to do with
"date" then you could find out like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>contentsl | fgrep -i date</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Using the above is far faster and better that running proc contents
yourself and you will often make use of it. The two scripts are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="scripts/contents" target="_blank">contents</a>: Show contents
in short form</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/contentsl" target="_blank">contentsl</a>: Show contents
in long form</li>
</ul>

<h2>
"formats" scripts</h2>
You will often need to know what formats exist either for a study or local
to a directory and how the start values map to their labels. The scripts
that exist to help you are again more convenient than using SAS software
yourself. Scripts such as these put information about SAS software objects
at your fingertips in your Unix session and help speed your work. The scripts
are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="scripts/showfmts" target="_blank">showfmts</a>: Display a list
of all study formats</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/showfmt" target="_blank">showfmt</a>: Display a single
study format</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/showlfmts" target="_blank">showlfmts</a>: Display a list
of all local formats</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/showlfmt" target="_blank">showlfmt</a>: Display a single
local format</li>
</ul>

<h2>
batch development scripts</h2>
Spectre is very much Unix oriented. Part of the reasoning behind it is
that once programmers know the Unix environment well then greater speed
plus a higher number of programs per programmer should be possible than
by going through an interactive reporting system. Recognizing that most
programmers are used to developing all their code in interactive SAS software
sessions, scripts exist to encourage you to do this in batch, instead,
by providing scripts that make batch development just as convenient as
interactive development. One of the most convenient aspects of interactive
development is the ease of moving from window to window like the program
window to the log window to the output window. Spectre provides scripts
so that you can do the same in batch mode. It relies on your declaring
what your program is to a Unix variable named "prog" that you have exported.
Suppose you were working on a demog table named "t_demog" then you declare
it to the "prog" variable like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>export prog&nbsp;&nbsp; # only needed once per xterm window</tt>
<br><tt>prog=t_demog</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Once your program name (without the .sas extension) is declared to the
"prog" variable then the following scripts can be invoked <b><i>without
values </i></b>to work on your program:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="scripts/sasb" target="_blank">sasb</a>: Run the program</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/sc.html" target="_blank">sc</a>: Scan the log for important
notes, warnings and errors</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/pgm" target="_blank">pgm</a>: Edit your program</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/log" target="_blank">log</a>: Browse the log</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/lst" target="_blank">lst</a>: Browse the .lst file</li>

<li>
<a href="scripts/lis" target="_blank">lis</a>: Browse the .lis file</li>
</ul>
Habits die hard so it might take you a long time to change over from developing
your code interactively to doing it in batch. But when you become good
with Unix, perhaps with the help of the learning materials on this web
site, you will be tempted to move over to batch development and you will
find that the above scripts will make you feel just at home using batch
as you did developing your programs interactively. Some time after you
have made the transition you will find that you are working faster in batch
than you ever did when working interactively.
<h2>
wt</h2>
"<b><a href="scripts/wt" target="_blank">wt</a></b>" is short for "<b>w</b>hich
<b>t</b>itles
member". It is short so you can type it in fast. It has a table reference
number for an argument and it returns the titles member without the ".titles"
extension. Nearly everybody you will be in contact with will refer to tables
and listings by their table or listing reference number so you need to
translate this into the program name quickly. You will be using "wt" a
lot to switch to a new value of "prog" using copy and paste like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>$ wt 13.2.1.3</tt>
<br><tt>t_demog</tt>
<br><tt>$ prog=t_demog</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
Hopefully, the above information will prove useful to you for getting the
most out of Spectre and allowing you to work at speed.
