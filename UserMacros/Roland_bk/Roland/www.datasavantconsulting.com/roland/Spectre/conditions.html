Conditions for Paid Spectre (Clinical) Support</h1></center>
<b>Last updated: 11 Jun 2015</b>
<p>All the code on this web site is free to use. You can make both commercial
and non-commercial use of it without paying anything.
<p>If you are a CRO or a pharmaceutical company with perhaps 20 or more
Clinical reporting SAS programmers working for you then you might consider
it worthwhile to take out a support contract to give you help and advise
with these macros and to have bugs fixed and enhancements made. The cost
of this is shown on the download page.
