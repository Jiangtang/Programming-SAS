<h1>
Macro Validation Plan</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
My aim is to "validate" <b>all</b> of my macros. This is made difficult
because nobody can be bothered to put in the considerable work required,
except for me, and being the sole author of all the macros then I am not
"allowed" to validate them. That's a pretty daunting obstacle to achieving
the full validation of the macros, I am sure you will agree, but I have
a plan!
<h2>
The "old way" of validating the macros</h2>
The "old way" of validating the macros was to validate only those macros
used in the process of creating submission reports being used by Spectre
(Clinical). When these macros were identified, the word "Production macro"
was put into the start of the purpose of the macro so that people could
identify and concentrate on just those macros. A problem was that when
I enhanced a macro or debugged it then I often had need to copy a macro
across from the old macro library and so make it a "production" macro,
so the situation was fluid and therefore hard to plan and to resource.
Also, there was the question of how to do it. This was not clear.&nbsp;
If you had specified the macro then you could validate it against your
specifications but how do you validate macros that you have not even asked
a person to write? Even discussing this could use up a lot of resources
and stretch out the time. This "old way" of validating macros was inapplicable
to the situation.
<h2>
The "who cares?" approach</h2>
Most of my macros are over ten years old. I very rarely encounter problems
with them. Used in the way I will use them, I know they will all work for
me just as they have always worked. Nearly everbody who has downloaded
and used my macros uses them for non-critical applications or just educational
purposes but when used in critical applications then I guess (and hope)
that what they produce as a final product is independently programmed.
It is far easier to do this than validate all the macros. The vast majority
of the users of the macros do not care if they are validated or not. It
makes no difference to them. The people who care about them being validated
are people who use the macros in the clinical reporting field where they
have a legal obligation to make sure that whatever it produces, for submission
purposes, has gone through their validation process and they have documented
evidence for this.
<h2>
The "current way" of validating the macros</h2>
The "new way" and now the "current way" of validating the macros involves
validating <b>all</b> the macros and not just the ones used in producing
submission reports. This gets around the fluidity problem where I sometimes
change the dependencies of the macros on other macros when I am doing updates.
With them <b>all</b> being validated then I do not have to worry about
what macros I call. Validating <b>all</b> the macros and webbing the evidence
that this has been done on this web site will hopefully mean that once
the validation is done, then it is done for all users. This will avoid
duplication of work. It is still a great deal of work so I have thought
of a way of defining, guiding and streamlining this process. I will give
full details of this. All the user then has to do is agree with my approach
for validating the macros and they will find nearly all the work done.
They will then just have to review the documentation, perhaps making minimal
tests themselves and then "sign off" the results. The big difficulty will
be in the end user <b><i>agreeing </i></b>with my approach for validation.
SOPs might have to be changed to accomodate the approach I am recommending
so I will have to make a very convincing argument for my case. I believe
I have done that and will explain it in the following "testpack" section.
<h2>
The "triple testpack" approach</h2>
I started writing testpacks for my macros a number of years ago. You can
link to many of these old test packs on this <a href="../sasautos.html" target="_blank">page</a>.
They were of limited use, however. I have now developed this idea further
into what I call a "triple testpack" approach. With this system, the macro
programmer (me) supplies a testpack to demonstrate that the macro works
in the way intended as an integral part of developing the macro. In the
testpack, the macro programmer (me) says what version of what macro is
being tested and for each test, gives the expected result of the test and
compares that to the actual result and writes a clear message in the log
if the test results were equal or not equal to the expected results. This
should be done to cover the full functionality of the macro (this will
be aimed at the low-level macros and not the major reporting macros %npcttab
and %unistats) although where there might be a set of parameters that have
the same function, then only two of these parameters need be tested (for
example the target1-target30 parameters in the macro <a href="macros/remove.html" target="_blank">%remove</a>).
The programmer testpack is <b>level one</b> testing and the programmer
fills in the header of the testpack appropriately. The second level is
where an independent programmer takes the programmer testpack, reviews
the programmer results to check that they are in agreement with it and
adds their own tests (a minimum of one) to ensure it is working in the
way they feel it should. They then update the header of the testpack appropriately
and <b>level two</b> testing is complete. Level three testing is done at
the user end. The user has to review the testing done. The user might agree
with what has been done and see no need for further testing or they might
add tests of their own. Once they have updated the header then that is
<b>level
three</b> testing complete and you have a fully-validated macro.
<p>Note that for later versions of macros then the added/altered functionality
(a version number increase <b><i>means</i></b> some functionality has been
amended or added) will have to be tested and the macro testpack will have
to go through the same procedure.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
In this document I have set out a plan for validating all of my macros
in a way that I hope will be acceptable to an end user that will minimise
the end user's efforts in the macro validation process.
