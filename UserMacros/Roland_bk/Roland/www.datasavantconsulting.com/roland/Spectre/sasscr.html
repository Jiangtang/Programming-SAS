<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Firstly, let's clear up any confusion. If you arrived at this page using
a search on "<b>sas script</b>" or "<b>script sas</b>" then this is not
the page you should be reading. A "sas script" is just another name for
a "sas program". This page is about writing <b>shell scripts</b> that call
sas. If this is not what you are interested in then you can leave this
page now.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>You should limit shell scripts that call SAS software to those needing
to get information from SAS software objects or those required to call
SAS software procedures. This is because invoking SAS software in a script
creates an overhead. For reading text, the language "<b>gawk</b>" is faster
and better. You can read about how to use gawk <a href="gawk.html">here</a>.
If your script combines information from a SAS software object with other
tasks not related to SAS software objects, then you should learn how to
split up your task into multiple scripts so that one script just acts on
the SAS software object and then outputs this information to other scripts
for further processing. Knowing how to split up tasks like this and the
best way to do it comes with experience.
<p>The reason you will want to write shell script that call SAS software
is to avoid using an interactive SAS session. Spectre favours batch working
so if programmers need information about SAS software objects or need to
call a SAS software procedures to show them some simple output then it
would help them if they could do this from the Unix command line. There
are already some shell scripts that call SAS software in Spectre such as
<a href="scripts/contentsl" target="_blank">contentsl</a>
and <a href="scripts/summary" target="_blank">summary</a> for this but
the list is not exhaustive. There will be times when you need to write
your own shell script that call SAS software.
<p>Writing shell scripts that call SAS software is very easy and to make
it even easier there a utility to help you do this that you will be introduced
to.
<h2>
Invoking SAS&reg; software with -stdio</h2>
If you have a script then it is good practice to have all the code you
are going to use in that script and not in an external file. The reason
for this is to avoid the possibility of somebody changing that code while
the script itself sits in a separate secure library. It is a matter of
security. So the easiest way to include SAS software code in a script is
to put it in a "<b>here document</b>", and if you have forgotten what that
is then click <a href="bashscr.html#heredoc" target="_blank">here</a>.
You also have to think about the user interrupting the script half way
through. If they interrupt the script then it is better to not have a code
member and a log member left over. One approach to get around this problem
is
to use the "here document" to write to a temporary code member, to execute
that code member and write the output to a temporary file, next to delete
the code member and the log and then to "cat" the temporary file to the
user's terminal and lastly to delete that temporary file. That way, if
the script gets interrupted, it will most likely get interrupted at the
"cat" stage with the sas member and log already deleted. But there is an
even neater way of doing it using the "<b>-stdio</b>" option. This way
you can feed your code in the "here document" directly into SAS software
with the log directed to the Unix dustbin <b>/dev/null</b> using "<b>2>/dev/null</b>"
and you can route the output to <b>stdout</b> in your code. That way nothing
gets left over if the script is interrupted.
<h2>
sasunixskeleton</h2>
There is a script named "<b>sasunixskeleton</b>" to help you create a shell
script that calls SAS software that uses the "<b>-stdio</b>" option. Here
is an example with me creating a script named "dummy" in my home directory.
I will use the script without an argument so "sasunixskeleton" will prompt
me for a script name.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>$ sasunixskeleton</tt>
<br><tt>Enter script name: dummy</tt>
<br><tt>This utility will generate a script and store it in the current</tt>
<br><tt>directory.</tt>
<p><tt>Enter purpose of script: Just a demo</tt>
<br><tt>script "dummy" has been generated and stored in the current directory</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>...and here is the script it created.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >

<br><tt>&nbsp; put @1 xxxx;</tt>

<br><tt>-----FINISH-----</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The script it created is <b><i>skeleton </i></b>script code, hence the
name of the utility "sasunixskeleton". You have to edit the script where
you see "EDIT" and add your code to the "here document" which is ended
by the string "-----FINISH-----" starting in the first column. Note the
options used when invoking SAS software. "-stdio" is needed but you may
need to change the default options "-noautoexec -sasuser work". With the
"<b>-stdio</b>" option in effect, the log gets written to <b>stderr</b>
(standard error) which has file handle "2" (standard output has file handle
"1") so you see I have routed the log to the Unix dustbin using "<b>2>/dev/null</b>".
If you are debugging the script then you will need to route the log to
a file in your home directory so you can look at the log and see what the
problem is. But don't forget to route the log back to <b>/dev/null</b>
again when you have finished debugging.
<p><b>The important thing you have to remember</b> is what happens to the
"$" (dollar) sign in a script. Just like you reference a macro variable
with a "&amp;" in front of it, scripts use the "$" sign to reference shell
variables. So if you have a format like this "$200." then it will cause
an error because it will look for a shell variable named "200". So to get
round this in the here document you should put an escape character "\"
in front of the "$" so you would write the same format as "\$200.". You
need to remember this. However, this does not apply to the script parameter
values "$1", "$2" etc..
<p>If your script creates normal print output then it will automatically
be written to <b>stdout</b> (standard output) which is what you want, as
this will go to the user's terminal. But if you "put" the values then you
must use "<b>file stdout</b>" so that the "put" values are written to standard
output.
<h2>
Examples</h2>
Here are some examples of shell scripts that call SAS software where the
output is normal print output.
<br><a href="scripts/summary" target="_blank">summary</a>
<br><a href="scripts/printall" target="_blank">printall</a>
<p>Here are some examples where "file stdout" is used.
<br><a href="scripts/contentsl" target="_blank">contentsl</a>
<br><a href="scripts/showlfmt" target="_blank">showlfmt</a>
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
Hopefully, you have seen how easy it is to create a shell script that calls
SAS software. Using the information in this document then the only difficulty
you should encounter is with the code itself, but then you should be an
expert with that in any case.
