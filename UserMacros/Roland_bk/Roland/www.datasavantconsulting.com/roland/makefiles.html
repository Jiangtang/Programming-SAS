<h1>
Makefiles vs. Scripts</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 06 August 2003]</b>
<h2>
The "make" utility</h2>
I admire the "make" utility that comes with Unix. It's an impressive piece
of software that, given the dependencies between programs and files, will
run generate a script to run programs in the correct order so that all
the dependencies are met. Also in the way that it knows when files have
been updated and will run from that point. If I had written the "make"
utility then I would be a proud person. But, I feel there is a problem
behind its use. Pharmaceutical companies will have written a utilitiy that
will generate the makefile from the dependencies in the program. But the
program it trawls through to find these dependencies may call other macros
or "include" files where dependencies are hidden. To overcome this it may
then become a "standard" to add all dependencies in the header of the macro
so this can be spotted by the utility to create the "makefile". But if
you do that then you are adding an overhead onto your maintenance in order
to service a utility. And if whatever it produces might be incomplete and
require programmer intervention then perhaps a simpler system would do
the job more efficiently and effectively. So if your "makefile" utility
at your site is working fine and requires no further input then carry on
as you are. But if you are having major problems with it that are not easily
resolved then perhaps you could look at running all your programs in a
generated script. I have written such scripts in the past. And where it
has not been a regulatory requirement to use a "makefile", I have always
opted for a script solution. I feel it is simpler and better. It does its
job and saves time and effort.
<h2>
intermediate dataset script</h2>
I assume you report from "value added" intermediate datasets. I have discussed
this approach on another page on this website. These will be in a directory
somewhere. You might have only one directory for all your programs. You
might have several. In using a script approach for running a suite of programs
then without the dependencies that the "make" utility can find then you
will have to name your programs in alphabetical order so that the correct
dependencies are met. In other words, the program that creates a dataset
that all the other programs need needs to have an alphabetically lower
value. Say <b>a0pat.sas</b> for creating a "pat" dataset that the other
programs need. The other programs could be <b>a1xxx.sas</b> or <b>a2zzz.sas,</b>
or whatever, so long as the alphabetic sequence was the correct one for
the dependencies. I am going to suggest a script for creating the intermediate
datasets you report from but of course I don't know your setup. If you
have studied all the Unix tips and scripts on this website then you will
be in a position to code this yourself based on the example I have supplied.
<p>So my assumption is that all the programs that build your intermediate
datasets are in their own library called "idsbuild". Of course, it won't
be like that where you are, but I hope you will be able to follow my logic
and adapt it to your own site. I am going to assume that you have all sorts
of test programs in the directory that hosts the real programs that build
your intermediate datasets. And that all the "real" programs begin with
an "a", "b" or "c" and are immediately followed by a numeric digit in the
program name. That may not fit your site but you need to know the techniques
for picking out your programs based on criteria like this. In the case
of the above, where a SAS program begins with either "a", "b" or "c" and
is immediately followed by a numeric digit then this command will list
them all:
<p><b><tt>ls [a,b,c][0-9]*.sas</tt></b>
<p>(You are learning about "file name matching" which is something different
to "pattern matching" in Unix and this is a very important thing to learn.
I will only teach you how to "walk" with scripts. Learning how to "run"
is something I am leaving you to learn on your own).
<p>So let's think about what we want our script to do. This program suite
will be creating intermediate dataset so we will want to delete these intermediate
datasets before we start. We will also want to delete any log and list
files for these programs. And if any of these log or list files or intermediate
datsets do not already exist then we are not bothered about it so we can
route any error messages to the Unix dustbin <b>/dev/null</b> . We are
going to generate the script to do this. So the generated script should
explain that it has been generated so that people do not amend it because
the next time it is generated their version will get wiped out. Presumably
some "raw" datasets exist in a directory. Let us suppose we have a root
directory defined to the environment variable RD (environment variables
shoudl always be uppercase) and that our protocol is the next on the directory
and the study is next and that our raw data is in the "raw" directory underneath
that then this would be a script to generate the script to build all your
intermediate datasets. There is another thing. If any of these intermediate
dataset build programs fail then we had better abandon the rest since it
is not going to work for the tables and listings programs at some stage.
Better to abandon the rest if this happens.
<p>Please take time to study the following script. Feel free to amend it.
It won't try to run the programs unless you launch it. One day you will
be asked to write a script like this.

<h2>
Tables/Listings report script</h2>
That is the intermediate dataset build taken care of. As for the tables
and listings then these should match with the entries in your "titles"
dataset, wherever that is stored. You should have already created the "intitles"
script. Like I've said in a few places - "It's your call". If you have
followed me this far then you are already a script programmer. There may
be plenty for you to fix in the scripts I have given you but you should
be up to maintaining them by now. Use this as a basis only:

# Contact&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : rolandberry@hotmail.com

# Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Make the directory with the report code in the current directory
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before invoking this script. This assumes the "intitles" script
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been written.

<h2>
Running the whole suite</h2>
At this point you will have a "build" script to build your intermediate
datasets and a "run" script in each tables/listings directory to run your
tables and listings. The final step is to create a script to run all of
them. You will be running the intermediate dataset build first and if that
fails then you might as well abandon the whole lot. But if that runs to
complaetion then maybe you don't care if the odd table or listing fails.
You can look at the output from the script to ascertain whether it completed
or not. Here is a very short script that you can amend to run the build
of the intermediate datasets and the reports. Amend it as required.
