Do not use SELECT COUNT(*) unless you really need to</h1></center>
<b>Updated: 06 May 2014</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
A lot of SAS programmers are moving away from using data steps towards
SQL programming. This is a good thing. SQL is a standard query language
used across many industries. It is a useful skill to have. However, if
you are not aware of the performance aspects of SQL then the SQL code you
write might take longer to run than the equivalent data step code. Perhaps
much longer. So as you learn SQL syntax you should learn the performance
consequences of using it. If you do this well then your SQL code will run
as fast as your data step code and perhaps a little faster.
<h2>
count(*)</h2>
You know what "count" means. It means count things. For count(*) then the
"*" means the rows so count(*) means count the number of rows. But if you
want to check for an empty or non-empty table then you are not interested
in a count of anything. You just want to know if it has one row with something
there or no rows at all. If you wanted to check for the existence of any
row with a missing value then you will have this information when you come
across the first row with a missing value. You do not need a count of them.
A count of something implies you are going to read through a whole table
when maybe just one row will do. SQL works differently to data step code
and SQL can stop after finding what it is looking for. It's like it issues
a "stop" by itself that you would have to code in a data step.
<h2>
Quiz question</h2>
What number will be displayed when the macro variable is resolved? Will
it be "1" or "10000000"?
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do x=1 to 10000000;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>select x into :mvar from test;</tt>
<br><tt>%put mvar=&amp;mvar;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you thought the correct answer was 10000000 then you could not be
blamed for thinking so - but you would be <b>wrong</b>. The SQL code will
stop as soon as it finds what it is looking for. It is looking to put something
in the macro variable "mvar" and it uses whatever value for x it finds
from the first row of the table (dataset) "test". The value displayed will
be "1" (actually "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1").
<p>Please allow the above to sink into your thinking until you become comfortable
with this idea. It is very important and it affects the way you will design
your SQL code to keep it efficient.
<h2>
count(*) vs. count(x)</h2>
Some people trick themselves into thinking that using count(*) is efficient
but that is because of a shortcut that SAS uses. In the following code
then which SQL <b>select</b> statement will run the fastest?
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do x=1 to 10000000;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select count(*) into :mvar from test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %put mvar=&amp;mvar;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select count(x) into :mvar from test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %put mvar=&amp;mvar;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now you might think the processing time would be similar but slightly
longer for "count(x)" because "count(*)" is counting the rows and "count(x)"
is counting the non-missing values of "x" which will take a bit more checking.
In fact, the "count(*)" runs in no time at all and "count(x)" takes significant
time. This is because SAS is using a short-cut. It knows how many observations
are in the dataset (table) "test" so it just has to pull out that value
and present it. It will not count up all the rows again. But with "count(x)"
it has to go through the process of counting them all.
<p>But then you might think that as long as you stick to using "count(*)"
then your code will run fast. Maybe something like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do i=1 to 10000000;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x=i;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if mod(x,100)=0 then x=.;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; drop i;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; create table missx as select * from test where x is missing;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select count(*) into :misscnt from missx;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %put misscnt=&amp;misscnt;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The select statement using "count(*)" will indeed run very quickly -
the trouble is you had to read through the full "test" table to create
the "missx" table and then when you asked for the value SAS accessed the
row count internally and presented it. But you had to read through the
whole "test" table and this was inefficient.
<p>The above SQL code is very wasteful because we created a table we are
probably not going to use. The following form of SQL is better:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do i=1 to 10000000;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x=i;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if mod(x,100)=0 then x=.;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; drop i;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select count(*) into :misscnt from test where x is missing;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %put misscnt=&amp;misscnt;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above form will be slightly faster than the code before but now
"count(x)" has a where clause involved and SAS will actually have to count
the rows. It has no internal value it can use.
<h2>
Detecting one missing value</h2>
This is the efficient way to detect if here are any missing values at all
in the table "test":
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do i=1 to 10000000;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x=i;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if mod(x,100)=0 then x=.;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; drop i;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select "Has missing value(s)" into :msg from test where
x is missing;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %put msg=&amp;msg;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above SQL will stop after it finds the first missing value which
will be at row 100. Then it will stop. You wanted to know if there were
"any" missing values so it found one and then stopped. This is efficient.
<h2>
Detecting empty/non-empty tables</h2>
Suppose you need to produce a report where missing values are detected.
You would need to create a table to do this otherwise you would have nothing
to print later in your code. But suppose you also need to set a message
somewhere if there were any rows with missing values or not. This is shown
in the following code and note that I am going to initialize the macro
variable before the select statement:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; create table missx as select distinct vara, varb, varc from
test where x is missing;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %let msg=;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select "Has missing value(s)" into :msg from missx;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; %if not %length(&amp;msg) %then %let msg=No missing values
found;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If the table "missx" has any rows in it (in other words missing values
for "x" were detected) then the select statement puts the text into the
macro variable "msg" and then stops. If there were no missing values then
"missx" has zero rows in it and the select statement will do nothing because
nothing was selected. And so "msg" will contain nothing. In fact it won't
even be initialized which was why I had to initialize it before the select
statement to make sure I did not get a syntax error when I tested its length.
<h2>
Using "exists"</h2>
Here is a typical test you might do. Assuming you need to keep the "dups"
dataset to report it then the following is not inefficient since SAS holds
the value of "count(*)" internally so "select count(*) from dups" processes
instantaneously as there is no "where" processing associated with it.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>update summary</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set Finding="Duplicate records found",</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impact=3</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where (criteria="DUP") and (0&lt;select count(*) from dups);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But to get into a better SQL coding habit then instead of the above
you could use "<b>exists</b>" like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>update summary</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set Finding="Duplicate records found",</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impact=3</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where (criteria="DUP") and exists (select 1 from dups);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
count(*) is not all bad</h2>
I do not want to give the impression that you should avoid all use of "count(*)".
Sometimes it is needed, especially where you have "group by" variables.
Suppose you needed to report of missing values but <b>only if there were
more than one row in a group</b>. They you would need to count the rows
by group and test for missing values of the rows per group were greater
than one. You would do it like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>select "x is missing where there is more than one row in a vara-varb
group" into :macvar from</tt>
<br><tt>(select 1 from dset</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;group by vara, varb</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;having count(*)>1 and x is missing);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how by using "count" you may be processing a whole table
when you do not need to and it is therefore less efficient than other methods
you can use. You have been shown how to avoid using "count(*)" but also
an example of its legitimate use.
