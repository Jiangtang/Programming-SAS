Getting SAS to work with Unix</h1></center>
<b>[last updated - 08 Sep 2007]</b>
<h2>
The BIG Secret</h2>
You have launched SAS jobs from Unix maybe thousands of times. But how
do you get SAS to be Unix-like and pass on information to native Unix utilities?
I bet you think you are going to learn a BIG secret here. I'm going to
tell you that BIG secret right away. Here it is. Ready for it?
<p><b>The BIG secret is.................................&nbsp;&nbsp; that
there <i><font size=+1>is</font></i> no BIG secret</b>
<p>This is what I am doing with SAS to get it to talk to other Unix utilities.
<ul>
<li>
Create a SAS program from inside a shell script that reroutes output to
a file</li>

<li>
run it</li>

<li>
delete the sas program (and optionally the log)</li>

<li>
"cat" the output file to the screen (standard output)</li>

<li>
delete the output file</li>
</ul>
Now what could be simpler than that?
<h2>
Simpler still</h2>
It can get simpler and I have made it simpler. Shell script syntax is very
unforgiving. It is easy to make mistakes and the messages you get out when
that happens are often less than helpful. So I wrote a utility called <b>sasunixskeleton</b>
that creates utilities. Yes, you read that right. A utility that writes
utilities. More specifically, it generates the script code for you so that
you need not write any script code yourself. All you have to do is design
the usage message that will be put to the terminal if the user invokes
the utility without any parameters (in other words they don't know how
to use the utility and want a help message) and get on with the business
of coding the SAS code. And you can spot the places you do this because
it says EDIT there in clear letters. You also get instructions on how to
do this within the generated utility.
<h2>
A good Unix book</h2>
Once you have generated your own scripts then you are going to get hungry
for Unix knowledge. You are going to see that it was easy all along and
you are going to want to come up to speed with Unix and will want to know
more about Unix commands and utilities. But what single book is best for
this? I'll tell you. It is that one you have sitting on your shelf at work
that you don't bother reading. It is called <b>"Unix in a Nutshell"</b>
and is published by <b>O'Reilly</b>. The book is useless if you don't know
any Unix but once you do know some Unix then the book becomes invaluable.
It is a concise source of all the important things you will need to know.
As for books on writing shell scripts, then I bought a book to help me
start out down that path as I had no guide. But it is easier to learn shell
script writing by following other people's examples and you will find plenty
of examples on this web site. You have no need for a separate book on this.
<h2>
Think Unix - think simple</h2>
Native Unix utilities give you <b>simple</b> information and always display
that information at your <b>terminal</b>. If you are going to write SAS
utilities to work on Unix then you must do the same. It is not like writing
a Clinical report. Remember the <b>"simple"</b> and <b>"write to the terminal"</b>
rule. Once you write a script for somebody else and they wake up to the
power that could be there at their fingertips then chances are you will
asked to amend your utility to make it "more user friendly in that it writes
to a file" or "it would be nice to show this extra information as well".
And you will have to refuse this request because it breaks the <b>"simple"</b>
and <b>"write to the terminal"</b> rule. You can't see at this stage why
this has to be a hard and fast rule. You will just have to take my word
for it for now. I'll try to explain, though, but you may not have a grasp
on it at this stage. The thing is that the real power of Unix utilities
lies in being able to pass information from one utility to another. And
in order for this to happen then the utilies expect other utilies to write
their information to "standard output" (the terminal by default) and need
to be able to pick up that information easily (and simply). So it is only
by keeping it simple like this that the utilities can talk to each other
and the full power of Unix be realised. In writing utilities such as these
you should not be thinking "How can I make it better?". You should be thinking
"How can I make it simpler?". Use "better" for Clinical reporting. Use
"simpler" for utilities.
