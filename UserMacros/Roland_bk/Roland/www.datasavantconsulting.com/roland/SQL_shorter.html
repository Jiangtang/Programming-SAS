<h1>
SQL shorter than sas code</h1></center>
<b>Updated: 18 Aug 2015</b>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
SQL code is usually shorter than normal SAS data step code for doing routine
work on data. With SQL, you do not need to sort datasets before you merge
them. That saves a lot of untidiness in the code. And your SQL statements
can be short, simple and clearly understandable, leading to code that is
clear and easy to maintain.
<p>As SAS programmers, you should not be trying to avoid using SQL. In
some cases it is better not to use it. For example, for doing complex joins
(especially with clinical data), data steps can be more convenient because
they allow you to set flags and whatever is needed to debug the merge where
you might be not getting what you expected. But for some uses, such as
data checking, SQL code can be a lot simpler and easier to understand.
<p>SAS programmers need to master both SQL skills and normal SAS data step
code skills and use them where appropriate. On this page you will see how
SQL can be shorter and clearer than using sorts and data steps in the cases
shown. Examples of some familiar uses will be shown and explained to help
you recognise the form of SQL to use when achieving what you already know
how to achieve using sort steps and data steps.
<h2>
Checking for one or more missing values</h2>
For this example, we are only concerned if for one variable in a data set
there is a missing value. Not how many. This will be fed back to the user
in a report to say if there were missing values found. It is up to the
user to remedy this. The actual count of missing values is not of interest
and besides, it might be a very large dataset and it is better not to read
the whole dataset as it might be time consuming. This is very basic checking,
typical of where a user submits data to an exchange server for their data
to be uploaded into a central database. This way of working will soon become
the standard for the pharmaceutical industry.
<p>Firstly the test dataset. I will create it with 10 million records and
set one in a thousand to be a missing value. Obviously, we will want to
avoid reading all 10 million records if we find a missing value in the
first thousand. Here is the code to generate the test dataset.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<br><tt>*-- create test dataset --;</tt>
<br><tt>data test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do x=1 to 10000000;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m=x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if mod(m,1000)=0 then m=.;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To test for a missing value using a data step then we will want to use
a "where" clause to select just missing values and then stop the processing
as soon as we have detected one missing value. If this is detected then
we will write it to a macro variable. We would do it like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let err_msg=;</tt>
<p><tt>data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>set test;</tt>
<br><tt>where m is missing;</tt>
<br><tt>call symput('err_msg',"M is missing");</tt>
<br><tt>stop;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above data step code is short. But it will be shorter using SQL.
Bear in mind that if you are doing error checking in SQL then this will
all be done in one or just a few invocations using <b>"proc sql noprint;"
</b>and
<b>"quit;"</b>
so that should not be counted as part of the code. These lines will be
omitted for the second example.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sql noprint;</tt>
<p><tt>%let err_msg=;</tt>
<br><tt>select "M is missing" into :err_msg from test where m is missing;</tt>
<p><tt>quit;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You might wonder in the above example how we stop after finding the
first missing value. But SQL does that automatically. Once it has found
a condition to satisfy the "where clause" and has moved the text into the
macro variable then it will stop as the operation has finished. As mentioned
previously, all your data checking could be done maybe in one call to "proc
sql" so let us look at the code without the invocation.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let err_msg=;</tt>
<br><tt>select "M is missing" into :err_msg from test where m is missing;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I think you will agree that the above is clearer and simpler than using
a data step. If you are vetting data submitted via an exchange server to
a database then you might be performing 40 or more checks on the data.
With SQL then these 40 or more checks should not take up many lines of
code and it will be clear what checks are being done at a glance. This
will not be so easy if data step code is used. If you numbered your checks
in a comment according to any row numbering that existed in a specifications
spreadsheet then you could see at a glance whether all the checks are being
done as specified and debugging them if there is a problem should be very
quick and easy.
<h2>
Checking if patients in a source table exist in a sample table</h2>
Let us assume that a user is uploading new "source" data on patients and
you would expect that these patients match what has already been uploaded
and databased in your "sample" data. We want a list of patients who should
not be there so the user can be informed and fix the incorrect patient
numbers.
<p>First, let us generate our test "source" and "sample" data:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>*-- create test datasets --;</tt>
<br><tt>data source;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do ptno=1 to 10;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>data sample;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do ptno=2 to 7;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can see from above that we need to flag patient numbers 1, 8, 9
and 10 in an error message. We would only want to flag a patient once so
with a data step we would need to do a "proc sort nodupkey" on both datasets.
This is where normal sas code starts to look messy. Assume this is all
contained in a macro so that you can use macro code as well such as "%if".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let string=;</tt>
<br><tt>%let err_msg=;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sort nodpukey data=source out=source2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by ptno;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>proc sort nodpukey data=sample out=sample2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by ptno;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>data _null_;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; length string $ 2000;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; retain string;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; merge source2(in=_a) sample2(in=_b) end=_last;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by ptno;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if _a and not _b;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if string NE " " then string=trim(string)||', '||compress(put(ptno,10.));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; else string=compress(put(ptno,10.));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if _last then call symput('string',trim(string));</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>%if %length(&amp;string) %then %let err_msg=Invalid patients (&amp;string)
found;</tt>
<p>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>And now for the SQL equivalent, and here I miss out the "proc sql noprint;"
invocation because I assume all checks will be done in a single call to
"proc sql". And if you do not know, then macro code can be freely mixed
with SQL code and even calls to macro can be mixed in with SQL code, so
long as these macros do not "push" any non-SQL sas code.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>%let string=;</tt>
<br><tt>%let err_msg=;</tt>
<p><tt>select distinct ptno into :string separated by ', ' from source</tt>
<br><tt>where ptno not in (select distinct ptno from sample);</tt>
<p><tt>%if %length(&amp;string) %then %let err_msg=Invalid patients (&amp;string)
found;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I think you can see from the above example that using SQL for simple
data checking can be clearer and far more elegant than using normal sas
code in some circumstances.
<h2>
FIRST. and LAST.</h2>
Many times you have wanted the observation whose value is the smallest
in a group or the largest in a group. You sort in the order you want and
use the <b>FIRST</b> or <b>LAST</b> observation in that group. You can
do the same with SQL but more directly by asking for the observations(s)
corresponding to the <b>minimum</b> or <b>maximum</b> for a group. Note
I used the word "<b>observations(s)</b>" because there might be more than
one observation satisfying the minimum or maximum value. But you can also
use "<b>distinct</b>" with your SQL select statement to give you just one
observation like you get using FIRST or LAST.
<p>First let us generate our test data. Note that for group "BB" there
are two observations with minimum value:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=5;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=2;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=4;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=9;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=5;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=9;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This is how we would select the observations with the minimum value
per group using sorts and data steps.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sort data=test out=test2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by grp x;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>data test_dset;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set test2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by grp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if first.grp;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The above is short and easy. One small inconvenience is that we needed
to create an extra dataset, assuming it was better not to sort the dataset
in place. But it is even easier with SQL, but you must remember to use
"distinct". I will miss out the "<b>proc sql noprint;</b>" invocation and
the "<b>quit;</b>" as most likely you will be using it in a long call to
"proc sql".
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<br><tt>create table test_sql as select distinct grp, x from test group
by grp having x=min(x);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can see that the above is clearly shorter <b>but</b> it is only
good for where you are selecting a limited set of fields such that you
know that using "<b>distinct</b>" will have the effect of dropping duplicates.
For cases where you have to select all fields (select *) you should use
the "<b>monotonic()</b>" function to create row number after ordering the
data and select on the minimum row number per group. Then it gets more
complicated and less efficient than using sorts and data steps. You effectively
have to do a "proc sort" and select on the minimum row number in each group.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>create table test2 as select * from test order by grp, x;</tt>
<p><tt>create table test_sql as select *, monotonic() as rownum from test2
group by grp having rownum=min(rownum);</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can see that the above is looking more complicated than normal sas
code and it will be less efficient due to having to calculate the minimum
row number.
<p>A warning at this point - for "proc sql", <b>the function monotonic()
is not supported</b>, even though it is there. Even the SAS Institute warns
about using it. My recommendation for even slightly complex cases is to
drop out of SQL and do it in a data step. You can use the "order by" ending
statement in your SQL code to put the data in the sort order you want and
then drop out of SQL, keep your "first" or "last" in a data step and reinvoke
"proc sql" again. It will be more efficient and reliable that way.
<h2>
The SQL query optimizer</h2>
A problem with using the monotonic() function is that in complex joins,
you may not get what you are expecting. SAS has an <b>SQL query optimizer</b>
(the same goes for most vendors of SQL) and so may change the join method
if it thinks doing so would be more efficient. So things might not be done
in the order you were expecting and so your monotonic() row numbers might
therefore be different. It may choose a different join method depending
on the number of observations so that when you rerun on different data
it may behave differently. Also it may change for later releases of SAS.
Because of this, using monotonic() can be unreliable. But back to this
"SQL query optimizer" again, an important topic.
<p><b>The SQL optimizer is both your friend and enemy.</b> With SQL doing
complex joins, especially using the innocent looking "," between tables
such as "table1 as a, table2 as b, table3 as c" which is an implicit <b>cartesian
join</b> (a cartesian join combines all rows with all other rows) then
the SQL optimizer will choose what it thinks is a better method to combine
the tables depending on the metadata it holds about the tables. It will
mostly make a better choice than you, especially as it can change its method
dynamically (sometinme even during the process). But sometimes it will
choose a method that is not the best method and an SQL join that took just
a few minutes might unexpectedly take a few hours the next time you run
it on different data so it is better to avoid using cartesian joins and
hope the optimizer will do the work for you. Using "inner join" is better.
Using normal sorts and data step merges on large volumes of data can be
time consuming but at least it is consistent and predictable. But for complex
SQL joins using large amounts of data then this can present a performance
nightmare unless you code your joins well - and sometimes even then it
can still be a performance headache. It may make you wish you never started
out down the SQL path.
<p>If you have taken the SQL path then one day you might be maintaining
some SQL code with cartesian joins in it. You might make a change that
you think will give an improvement but find the performance worsens to
a marked degree. There is a<b> lot </b>to learn about the SQL optimizer
and you can find out how complex this subject is by following this <a href="http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/101-30.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>.
<h2>
List Aggregation</h2>
Aggregating a list of items over a group is a common enough requirement.
You sometimes need to have a list of unique items for each group, maybe
separated by commas. Here we come to an instance where <b>"proc sql" is
difficult to use for this</b>. It is because it is lacking a function to
do this. Other versions of SQL have functions to do this.
<b>Oracle</b>
SQL has the function <b>listagg()</b>, for example (Google for this if
you are interested). Different vendors' versions of SQL have other-named
functions to do this. "Proc sql" has no such function at the time of writing.
<p>First our test dataset (we will use the one in the previous section):
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data test;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=5;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=2;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=4;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="AA";x=9;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=5;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=9;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; grp="BB";x=1;output;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This is how we would aggregate the list of unique "x" per group using
sorts and data steps. Note that when we sort it is "<b>nodup</b>" so we
only get unique values of "x" per group:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sort nodupkey data=test out=test2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by grp x;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<p><tt>data summary_ds;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; length xlist $ 200;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; retain xlist " ";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set test2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by grp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if first.grp then xlist=compress(put(x,10.));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; else xlist=trim(xlist)||', '||compress(put(x,10.));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if last.grp then output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; keep grp xlist;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now here is the "proc sql" version. It is <b>messy</b> because we have
no "<b>listagg()</b>" function or the equivalent. <b>I always drop out
of SQL and use sorts and data steps like the above when I have to do this</b>
but I will show you how to do it (less efficiently) with SQL. You can not
have a "<b>retain</b>" variable with SQL. Instead you have to put the values
in a <b>macro variable</b> and <b>update a summary dataset </b>with this,
one row at a time. Here is how it is done but <b>don't use this technique
in real life</b>. Wait until "proc sql" has something like the "listagg()"
function and use that. Use the above method instead but it might interest
you to know how to do it "<b>the hard way</b>" using "proc sql". I am using
a macro loop in the code below so you will have to assume this is done
inside a macro.
<p>Note that I am creating a row number using the "<b>monotonic()</b>"
function and I create this in an "<b>outside select</b>" so I apply the
row numbers to the summarised list:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>create table summary as select *, monotonic() as rownum from</tt>
<br><tt>(select distinct grp, " " as xlist length=200 from test);</tt>
<p><tt>%do i=1 %to &amp;sqlobs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select distinct x into :xlist separated by ', ' from</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; summary as a&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; inner join</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; test as b</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; on a.grp=b.grp</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where rownum=&amp;i;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; update summary</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set xlist="&amp;xlist"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where rownum=&amp;i;</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that "<b>sqlobs</b>" is an automatic variable that will contain
the number of observations in the table last created. We could also put
the number of observations in a macro variable like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>create table summary as select *, monotonic() as rownum from</tt>
<br><tt>(select distinct grp, " " as xlist length=200 from test);</tt>
<p><tt>select count(*) into :nobs from summary;</tt>
<p><tt>%do i=1 %to &amp;nobs;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select distinct x into :xlist separated by ', ' from</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; summary as a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; inner join</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; test as b</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; on a.grp=b.grp</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where rownum=&amp;i;</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; update summary</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; set xlist="&amp;xlist"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; where rownum=&amp;i;</tt>
<br><tt>%end;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Another Merge</h2>
In this example of a merge we want to flag situations where an identifying
variable value also occurs in other datasets. Here is the code to create
the test datasets and how to do a data step merge at the end:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>data base;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do x=1 to 10;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; end;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>data test1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=4;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=6;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=7;output;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>data test2;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=6;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=7;output;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; x=9;output;</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>*- Merge to flag where identifying variable value exists in other
datasets -;</tt>
<br><tt>data base_plus;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; merge base test1(in=_1) test2(in=_2);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; by x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if _1 then action1="1";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; if _2 then action2="2";</tt>
<br><tt>run;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The SQL replacement for the final <b>merge</b> step is not obvious (I
had to ask other people how to do it). But if you ignore the start and
quit of the "proc sql" call you can see it is actually very simple and
elegant and just as short as the data step merge.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt>proc sql;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; create table base_plus as</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; select a.x,(select "1" from test1 where x=a.x)&nbsp; as
action1&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
,(select "2" from test2 where x=a.x)&nbsp; as action2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; from base as a;</tt>
<br><tt>quit;</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Displaying duplicates and where they can be found</h2>
Sometimes you do a check where a condition should have unique occurrences
and you find it is not the case. Suppose for certain values of variables,
there should only be one measurement unit to go with it but you find there
are more than one. You might want to report not only these different measurement
units but also help the user locate them in their data by showing them
the unique combinations of values associated with the duplicate units.
The following example shows a reporting dataset being created to do this
in a piece of code I wrote. I will let you study it and work out exactly
what it is doing. Note that it is being done in a single SQL statement
(ending with the semicolon). Although it is a long statement, it is a lot
tidier than trying to do the same with data steps and "proc sort"s.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><tt></tt>
<br><tt>create table &amp;source._det350(label='Multiple KP Units found|FT03')
as</tt>
<br><tt>select 1 as holder, a.*</tt>
<br><tt>from (select distinct PKPERc, ACTEVENT, PKMATRIX, ANALYTE, KPNM,
KPU from &amp;source) as a</tt>
<br><tt>INNER JOIN</tt>
<br><tt>(select distinct PKMATRIX, ANALYTE, KPNM from</tt>
<br><tt>(select distinct PKMATRIX, ANALYTE, KPNM, KPU from &amp;source)</tt>
<br><tt>group by PKMATRIX, ANALYTE, KPNM</tt>
<br><tt>having count(*) > 1) as b</tt>
<br><tt>on a.PKMATRIX=b.PKMATRIX and a.ANALYTE=b.ANALYTE and a.KPNM=b.KPNM</tt>
<br><tt>order by PKPERc, ACTEVENT, PKMATRIX, ANALYTE, KPNM, KPU;</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Nowarn</h2>
Sometimes you are going to be annoyed by the warning messages that "proc
sql" puts out and wish they were not there as they are not telling you
anything you don't already know that you are already happy about. To switch
off the warnings you can call "proc sql" as "<b>proc sql nowarn;</b>".
This will disable warnings for the whole "proc sql" invocation right up
to the "quit;". If you want to disable the warnings for specific "proc
sql" statements then instead you can use "<b>reset nowarn;</b>" before
the SQL statement(s) you wish to switch off the warnings for and use "<b>reset
warn;</b>" after the statement(s) to switch the warnings back on again.
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
You have seen how SQL code can be shorter and clearer than the equivalent
normal sas code in some circumstances. Also, what SQL equivalent code looks
like for some common uses of normal sas code. You have also been introduced
to the SQL query optimizer.
