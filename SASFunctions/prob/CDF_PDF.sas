PDF function: This function is the probability density function. 
	It returns the probability density at a given point for a variety of distributions. 
	(For discrete distribution, the PDF function evaluates the probability mass function.)

CDF function: This function is the cumulative distribution function. 
	The CDF returns the probability that an observation from the specified distribution 
	is less than or equal to a particular value. 
	For continuous distributions, this is the area under the PDF up to a certain point.

QUANTILE function: This function is closely related to the CDF function,
	but solves an inverse problem. Given a probability, P, it returns the smallest value, q, 
	for which CDF(q) is greater than or equal to P.



To calculate probablities for discrete distributions, use
	PDF('distribution', parameters);

To calcualte P(X <= x), use 
	CDF('distribution', parameters);

It computes the probability that a standard normal r.v. is less than (or equal to)

us P(0 < Z < value)

Suppose our random variable Z is standard normal

/*
With continuous random variables, and often with discrete random variables, we want to
compute probabilities like P(3 < X <= 10) or P(.02 < hatp < .075). For such problems, a
cumulative distribution function (CDF) is much more useful than a PDF


. Let뭩 return to the binomial case, this time with n = 25 and p = 0.45.
We뭠l be interested in computing
P(10 < X <= 20). One way to do this is to add P(X = 11) +P(X = 12) +  +P(X = 20).1
We can do this via the pdf function.
Note that X = 10 is not included, since the inequality has 10 < X.

Another way to write this problem is
P(10 < X <= 20) = P(X <= 20) - P(X <= 10).

The CDF at x returns P(X <= x),


To answer our problem we can either use
0.14189 + 0.15831 +    + 0.00126 or 0.99993 - 0.38426.

1.1 Calculating the binomial coefficients
To evaluate binomial coefficients, you need the factorial function:
FACT(5);
which computes 5!. So, you can compute the binomial coefficients 5!/(3!(5 - 3)!) with
FACT(5)/(FACT(3)*FACT(5-3));
Calculating binomial coefficients is a common task, and there is a SAS command specifically for
doing so:
COMB(5,3);
does the exact same thing as the longer way listed above.
